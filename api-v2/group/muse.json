  "description": ":This article is about the idol group. For other uses, see Muse (disambiguation). Season 1 Episode 3 (Initial Members) Season 1 Episode 8 (All Members) μ's (pronounced \"Muse\") was a school idol group formed and led by Honoka Kosaka in Love Live!. They were the school idol group of Otonokizaka High School. The group consisted of nine members and was initially formed with the purpose of bringing attention to the school as it was to be shut down due to a lack of future enrolling students. The group disbanded in the anime after the 3rd years graduated, staying true to their status as school idols, unlike their rival A-RISE, which chooses to stay an idol group even after graduation of high school. In other words, μ's no longer exists as an idol group. However, they did make their final appearance in the movie. They originally debuted with the song Bokura no LIVE Kimi to no LIFE before they disbanded in 2016 prior to the release of their final single. Their real life parallel of the voice actresses ended activities as a group on April 1, 2016 with the Final Live, ending their legacy. However, it was announced that the group would be returning with a new single, which was released on March 25th, 2020. They also performed at the Love Live Fest in 2020.",
