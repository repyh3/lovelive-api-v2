  "description": ":This article is about the school idol group. For other uses, see Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (disambiguation).  Japanese Title = English Title =  The Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (虹ヶ咲学園スクールアイドル同好会), often abbreviated as Nijigaku (ニジガク), is the collective name of school idols from Nijigasaki High School. They were originally created as a new set of girls — joining µ's and Aqours — exclusive for the mobile game Love Live! School Idol Festival ALL STARS. They debuted with the song TOKIMEKI Runners when the group still consisted of nine members. The idol club initially started as a 5 member unit led by Setsuna Yuki until falling apart due to creative differences and has been reassembled with 13 members: 12 school idols and Ayumu's childhood friend, the player/protagonist, as their manager and song composer in All Stars. For the anime adaptation, a new character named Yu Takasaki was used to adopt the role of the player.",
