  "description": "Edel Note is a school idol duo that was formed by Izumi Katsuragi. They were the school idol duo of Mizukawa Girls' School. The unit was initially formed with just Izumi as the sole member, where she debuted with the song Edelied. But due to a petition, Ceras was allowed to join Izumi as a member of Edel Note during the Love Live! tournament play-offs. Edel Note later joins the Hasunosora Girls' High School Idol Club as a unit when they transferred to Hasunosora Girls' High School. Their unit color is white. Edel Note was re-formed again at Hasunosora but with a one-year time limit so they don't break Hasunosora's tradition of having 3 units. In November 2025, Izumi has decided she'd go solo in the 106th term, while Ceras still hasn't decided what she'll do.",
