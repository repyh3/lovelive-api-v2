Two stars crossed paths in the night sky
Someone saw it, and called it "hope"
Looking back... we saw the world differently,
Our reasons were too misaligned to truly connect
I look away, I try to disappear, but you won't let me be alone
I closed my eyes trying to hide but the light's too dazzling
In the ever-turning sky, we shine like we're an asterism
A prism casting light on time that never grows old
I will never forget you on this night
When countless constellations dance
Through many sleepless nights, I made it here
And learned that I'm not alone
Through unfulfilled dreams, I made it here
And realized that everything was "hope" in disguise
I just didn't want to leave... was that really too much?
My true feelings came out sounding like someone else
I gathered tiny scattered stars to draw a shape that's all my own
Yet, somehow, you were there all along, and I didn't even notice
In the ever-turning sky, we shine like we're an asterism
I realized then... I had nowhere left to go
The three aligned first-magnitude stars
Are forever and always inside my heart
My tears fall like shooting stars, bearing hope for the future
As I make my wish in this moment
Surely, even if we're born again, we'll still be an asterism
A rhythm unbroken within the cycle of reincarnation
I'll still always choose you, even on the nights
When countless constellations sing
Through many sleepless nights, I made it here
And learned that I'm not alone
Through unfulfilled dreams, I made it here
And realized that everything was "hope" in disguise
