Respond to me, signal
Meow! I cast it into space
Meow! Billions of light-years away
We just want, we just want, we just want
To exchange some more words with you today too
Meow! Flying freely through the skies
Meow! Even to the nameless little stars
Alright, let's get this party started
After all, this is our big floor!
Stuff about tomorrow, or adult problems and all that...
I get it, I get it, I really do - but hold on
Why don't we clash with our true feelings?
Meow! No matter what, "it's always fun!"
And my heart feels weightless
A spinning star, shining its light
Quickly transforms into a mirror ball
Meow, after all, we're all just human, right?
That's why the most important thing is our passion
I'll leave the thinking for later, but for now,
Respond to me, signal
Meow! Wishes begin to dance
Meow! Towards a night that seemed lonely
While I was blasting off into my spaceship,
I got mistaken for a shooting star
But maybe that's not so bad
With my big ears I won't miss a thing,
Whether it's your mutters or your shouts, I'll catch them all
Now we can, now we can, now we can
Truly call, truly call each other friends
Maybe it's bothersome, or maybe I should read the atmosphere
I get it, I get it, I really do
But hey, wait, wait, wait a sec!
What do you want to do? That's all I need
Let's go!
Drop the needle onto Jupiter's rings
And play your favorite music at full volume
Everyone, live your life the way you love!
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
It's a meow-meow kitty cat~
Can you hear me...?
I'm speaking...
Directly...
Into your brain...
Why don't we clash with our true feelings?
Meow! No matter what, it all comes down to "it's so fun!"
These shining days are more dazzling than the starry sky itself
Meow, after all, we're all just human, right?
That's why the most important thing is our passion
I'll leave the thinking for later, but for now,
Respond to me, signal
It'll turn it into the brightest smile!
Today, somewhere in the universe
Is you, my one and only
