I tried to wrap my fingers around
The little piece of the jigsaw puzzle, the sky I’m looking at with you
It’s already time, it’s sunset glow
There’s a crescent moon pattern on the indigo-dyed curtain
Shall we go home? Even the crows cawed
May there be fine weather tomorrow
Ah, I could laugh this way
Ah, I’ve been living without knowing anything
Every time I connect the dots,
The resolution increases and it gets clearer
Enjoyment, cherishment, love,
Let’s make the moments that are there forever
Not a single one is wasted
One Pixel’s irreplaceable present
The profile of you stretching your back with dignity,
Even your face that turns away to hide your embarrassment,
I’ll cut them out without spilling anything
These eyes are always chasing you
Piece!
I removed the filter, wanting to know
A piece of the world, the sky you want to see
Ah, I’ve been waiting for a future like this
Ah, It’s too dazzling, what should I do?
I just changed the angle a little
It’s more striking than I imagined
Every delight, every high note, and every thank you,
I’ll photograph every emotion that there is
I won’t miss a single one
I’ll stare motionlessly at you and try to capture them
You’re crying face that’s hidden behind a textbook,
Even your sleeping face that slumbers by the window,
I’ll cut them out without spilling anything
You see, turn around and look my way, what can you see?
Beyond the backlighting of waving hands,
The fast paced city
Makes me feel lonely
The nights are long
Until we meet in a dream
Enjoyment, cherishment, love,
Let’s make the moments that are there forever
Not a single one is wasted
One Pixel’s irreplaceable present
The profile of you stretching your back with dignity,
Even your face that turns away to hide your embarrassment,
I’ll cut them out without spilling anything
These eyes are always chasing you
Piece!
