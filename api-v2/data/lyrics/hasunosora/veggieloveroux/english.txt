There's no doubt about it, you're the sun that lights my heart
Even the days we can't meet still shine (in my heart)
Candy-colored sweet dreams (so enticing)
This premonition is spicy (so tempting)
Gently simmering inside me is a quiet wish (ever-changing)
This bright red passion has me bursting like a tomato
Look at me now
Just like a flame-kissed eggplant, my overflowing feelings are waiting to be tasted, please, say them out loud
Choose me Choose me
Go on - don't overthink it. Add the (topping)
From start to finish, not a single sweet step (this is a spicy romance)
Choose me Choose me
Drawn in by your tempting scent, but don't you dare tease me (don't you dare tease me)
Maybe we should take our time and melt together? (Hey, hurry up...)
Try me!
Can you please notice me? I've always been right here
Whether it's a crazy day or a quiet day (I'm on your side)
I've hidden something (for you)
You think you know (but you don't know me)
I'm in an unknown world, getting even hotter (I'm about to melt)
Like an avocado, you hide so much beneath the surface; a mystery I want to taste
Show me your heart
Pure popcorn dreams, bursting in the air, I want to taste all its possibilities, and savor every one
Choose me Choose me
I'm begging you, please don't hesitate (Come on)
We've gone from 10 to 100 on this rising stage (it's a fiery process)
Choose me Choose me
The magic of an eternal loop is held in a miracle (held in a miracle)
Let me drift of dreaming about the future (hey maybe someday you'll...)
Love me!
(Choo Choo Choo) (Choo Choo Choo)
(Choo Choo Choo) (Choo Choo Choo)
Just say it out loud
Choose me Choose me
Go on - don't overthink it. Add the (topping)
From start to finish, not a single sweet step (this is a spicy romance)
Choose me Choose me
I'm begging you, please don't hesitate (Come on)
We've gone from 10 to 100 on this rising stage (it's a fiery process)
Choose me Choose me
The magic of an eternal loop is held in a miracle (held in a miracle)
It feels like a dream but it's real (right here, right now...)
Love me! Try me!
