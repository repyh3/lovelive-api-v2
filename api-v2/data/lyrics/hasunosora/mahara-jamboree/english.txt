I, I, I love you, it's not enough.
I want to dance right now (let's dance together)
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
What it this?
Beyond the sapphire sea, sailing to the golden land
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Where are we?
It's still too early for the drama to start
I'm a little nervous if everything will go well
I don't know if I'm your type,
But make me your princess, Maharaja
Aren't you happy, aren't you happy that you met me?
Don't you want to love, love me, even though I'm so cute?
Recommend only me, please, Maharaja.
It's a request.
Egg fried rice is my specialty.
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Priya, Pyaar, Sapna
Is there a problem?
Even in curry form I'm human
If my heart is masala, everything is fine
For starters, don't worry about the little things
Just accept everything, Maharaja
Passion is like a chili pepper, burns every time you take a bite.
The mirage is swaying and swaying, tingling me in my dreams.
The thermometer shows a high temperature, but I can't lie down.
My skirt is swaying and swaying, I can't wait for
The music and feast of blessings.
Aren't you happy, aren't you happy to be here now?
Let's set off huge, huge fireworks and dance together.
Aren't you happy, aren't you happy that you met me?
Don't you want to love, love me, even though I'm so cute?
Recommend only me, please, Maharaja.
It's a request, an absolute request.
