We've all really come so far, haven't we?
The sky turns to the colors of daybreak
I wonder what kind of dreams the glittering star,
Tired from playing, sees as it falls asleep
As it threatened to blur, I pulled that
Fragile outline just a little bit closer
As if gently reaching beyond
The period to stay connected
Bathed in the glow of the morning light, a new world appears and once more,
I find myself yearning for something that's not there
I wonder, is this dream-sickness?
At the end of the night,
I felt a stir of something new, and it left me floating
That soft warmth, not quite love yet something clear
Was the prologue you gave to me
In the stillness, I searched for something I couldn't name
Maybe it was a version of myself who would be proud of the path she walked
Drifting once more, heavy with sorrow,
Maybe one day I'll know the reason why
That even an unnamed pain
Can quietly begin to heal
Here in this city
The feeling of your hand in mine, and your playful smile as well
The scent of the wind, the song of the birds, everything, all of it is taken along
I won't let go; from now on and forever
Bathed in the glow of the morning light, a new world appears and once more,
I find myself yearning for something that's not there
It's all because of this dream-sickness
At the end of the night,
I felt a stir of something new, and it left me floating
This loud, overwhelming heartbeat
Has me a little confused, but
That soft warmth, not quite love yet something clear
Was the prologue you gave to me
