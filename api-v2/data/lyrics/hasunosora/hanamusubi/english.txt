I can't stay here forever
Yes, I know, but
Wait just a little
Just a bit longer, please
While weaving today
The threads of time are spun
I really have to go, don't I?
In this world (in this world)
There's only one
A day that adorns with embroidery-like moments
A wish that will never unravel (a wish that will never unravel)
Not even until eternity
"We'll always be together"
Unchanging, even from now on
Let's tie a little flower
On your little finger
A flower that no one can see
Now, let it bloom
Also on my little finger
I must've been careless
For a moment, the needle tip touched
Why, wait
Please, stop the tears, it's because
I don't want to regret anything
If it will become a shared memory
I want it to be with a smile
Twisting together (Promise you)
The past (Promise me)
And the future (Forever)
Let's tie them tightly
Let's tie a little flower
On your little finger
A flower that no one can see
Now, let it bloom
So that we can meet again someday
Also on my little finger
To tomorrow... let the flowers bloom
