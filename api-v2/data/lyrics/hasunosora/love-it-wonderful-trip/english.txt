All of us, me, the rabbit, the bird, and the dog,
We traveled far, searching for the magic apple (all together)
Before I knew it, I'd wandered deep into the woods
And found myself lost in a forest... where am I?
Is it this way? (Let's give it a try)
It's so dark... (Then let's hold hands)
Just knowing that you are by my side, makes me so much stronger
C'mon, let's go!
Even in the pouring rain, hungry, and tripping over traps
Even if trouble keeps coming our way, one after another, it's okay!
If we put our strength together, I know we can overcome anything
Because on the other side of these woods is our very own shine waiting for us
I get anxious when the answers aren't clear,
I start to question if this is the right road (but, even so)
The tears I shed until now weren't for nothing
I know that someday they'll become a rainbow
Hey, check it out! (A shooting star!)
It's over there! (We found it!)
If we just keep moving forward (yeah) any sky (no matter how dark) will eventually clear
C'mon, let's go!
We'll face the mountains, valleys, and the edge of everything
Even if trouble keeps coming our way, one after another, keep moving!
This is the one page that connects us to the future waiting past the trees
So let's draw a new dream with a color that belongs only to us
C'mon, even in the pouring rain, hungry, and tripping over traps
That's right, the good and the bad, it all helps me grow
We're almost out of the forest and our futures will begin
Surely (with light) it will shine
(Alright) c'mon let's go!
We'll face the mountains, valleys, and the edge of everything
Even if every day is totally unpredictable, it's okay!
Because none of us are ever truly alone, we can overcome anything
Together, let's reach out beyond the trees and grab that sparkle we've been chasing after
The future's out there, waiting just for us
