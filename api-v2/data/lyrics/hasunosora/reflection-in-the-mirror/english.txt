Whenever you laugh, I laugh too. Whenever you cry, I cry too
We look at each other through the mirror
What a strange world it is, in the scenery spread before my eyes
Everything is reflected upside down (It's another world)
I wonder if it's okay that I'm like this... (I'm worried)
If I turn my back, I'm sure I'll be alone.
I can only believe in myself, which is here
Which essentially means to believe in you
We can go anywhere, right? Then on the count of three let's break this wall.
If we can join hands, our dreams will no longer be just dreams
The light, reflecting diffusely from their transparent fragments
It sparkles and shimmers — this is our future
Although I don't look for my mistakes, I run into them all the time
Asking myself more and more new questions, I got into a labyrinth, from which there is no way out
I wonder if this is because you mark "correct answer" when I myself mark "wrong"?
"I just need to be myself" — now I can think so (I'll just be myself)
Words alone are not enough for this... (Want to tell)
With them I cannot convey even half of what is in my heart
As I erased everything from my blurred vision with my exhaled breath
What appeared before me was definitely a miracle
We can do anything, right? Then on the count of three let's break another wall.
"I want to fulfill my dreams with you" — this reason alone is enough for me
Let's jump over the line, dividing us, — this is just the start line
Whatever our path, we have nothing to fear.
Hey, can you hear me, mirror, oh mirror?
Now I won't need you anymore
Here is the answer I definitely found
Everything around me is so beautiful...
If I close my eyes, I'll understand that this place is so warm, that it brings tears to my eyes
With you I clearly, clearly feel the proof that I'm alive
We can go anywhere, right? Then on the count of three let's break this wall
If we can join hands, our dreams will no longer be just dreams
The light, reflecting diffusely from their transparent fragments
It sparkles and shimmers — this is our future
