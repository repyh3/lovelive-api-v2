Why, hey, why can't I smile?
That's strange, huh? It's awkward, huh? I'm getting covetous!
Why, hey why do I feel so scared?
Even though all I'd wanted was just one view of the sunset
I was so mesmerized stepping out of the shade I couldn't help reaching out my hand
To the hazy sunset and your shadowy silhouette!
I feel as if I'm being painted over by emotions with exception of admiration
Every time I hold it out into the light
Far away, hey, far away, don't go and leave me
Just kidding... I'm sorry... Let's just drop the subject
It'd just be so painful if something I lost to time
That I had completely forgotten about were to be given a clear form
As I slipped out of the shade, I chased after your retreating figure
No need to go unnoticed, that's what a silhouette is
I don't need a place I can return to, so I just want you to stay by my side
There's nothing more than this I'd ever hope for
I was aware of the self-righteousness caused by getting carried away by the heat of the sun
In a place close to eternity, I'm now just a silhouette of my former self!
I wonder, will you forgive me even if I give you a cowardly and dishonest answer?
If only there was another tomorrow
If only there is a tomorrow...
