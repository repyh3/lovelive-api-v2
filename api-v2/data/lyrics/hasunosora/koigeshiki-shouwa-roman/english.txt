Tears shot out as I looked around,
I'd gone to the wrong ticket gate and missed you
I kept you waiting for two hours, and you're not here,
But left on the message board is a note that says:
"Waiting at Café Den'en"
To fall in love is to brave the unknown
Where wild surprises strike us both head on
Sorry! I keep on messing up,
But now I've come to know your kind heart
Oh yeah! Let's order a cream soda and chicken rice,
We can split it between us
Every time you share your dreams,
My heart seems to skip a beat... like today!
With my family lost in Monday night's drama,
I slip out of the living room and into the night
Though we were together just two hours ago,
There's still so much I didn't get to say
Now it's just me and this glowing phone box
Falling in love... really is a fight, huh?
My courage is really being tested right now
Drop in a ten-yen coin, fake a sweet smile,
And try to keep Mother happy
Finally, it's you, my heart's ready for this love mission
Operation Romance: Total Victory, let's go!
Day by day, our memories are increasing
I wonder if our anniversary is still far off? ...Here's a kiss!
Woo... Pure Love
Can you feel my sweet heart
Chu-chu-chu
Woo... Pure Love
Everybody knows Love is dream
Falling in love really is like a fairy tale, huh?
Even in the depths of heartache, love finds a way to bloom
Sorry! Forgive my blushing face
But my heart's stuck on a girly rhythm I can't shake
I'm all over the place and my heart's on fire!
But one day, you'll pull me into a fearless hug
There's one thing I know for sure:
Tomorrow will be a better day than today
As for that future version of us - see you in the sequel
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
...Showa!
