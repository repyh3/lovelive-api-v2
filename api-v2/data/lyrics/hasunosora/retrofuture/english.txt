In the space between restraint and the things I long for
Is a fleeting moment constricted by time, that I choose to call hope
The boiler is encrusted with rusted-out pretty lies
Harboring a heat so intense, my body creaks under the strain
I'll become a new symbol for this world,
Wielding my vulnerability and gadgets like they're armor
If I've got my bravado in my bag, then that's all I need to keep going
Let's celebrate life as we sing its praises
Alone, we're nothing but fragile gears, but when we're together,
We will make miracles happen
Even if it's as impossible as slicing through scalding, chaotic water
Would you still be the one to come and save me?
Just as embers emerge from rain-soaked ashes
If you seek it with all your heart, that flame will reignite
Even if the world is worn down, faded,
Shrouded in sorrow or heavy with smoke
Even if the fog of doubt covers up everything
Go on angel, and smile in the open sky
Letting this passion blaze its path in trails of steam and fire
Carving out a way forward, no matter what
The path of thorns and the road of serpents, that's the track legends run on
Rouse yourself!
Come on, come on, what is it you really want? I want to change!
It's the fear that makes me fight harder to become strong
I'll become a new symbol for this world,
Wielding my vulnerability and gadgets like they're armor
If I've got my bravado in my bag, then that's all I need to keep going
Let's celebrate life as we sing its praises
Alone, we're nothing but fragile gears, but when we're together,
I'll make sure this name is never forgotten
We will definitely make miracles happen!
