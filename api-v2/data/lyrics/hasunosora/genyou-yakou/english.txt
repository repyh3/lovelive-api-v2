"I can go further," a voice bounces
A small shadow is skipping stones on the water
"Hey, you and me as well," you laughed
I'm being grandiose, but you're just like a shooting star
Ripples of light are running on the surface of the water
On a night when the galaxy is strewn with gems
Let's make our wishes come true tonight
To somewhere that's not here,
As far as a place that no one knows yet,
As the whole city looks away to the sky,
We'll keep heading far away like this,
Going down along the river as far as we can
I'll never let go of this hand I've so tightly held ever again
I'm not... afraid of... even the darkness
When I'm with you, it's so dazzling
Every emotion and every scene,
Let's arrange them all into one constellation
Even without looking through a telescope
I can see what's important
Since the day that I met you
It's fine to convey them, right?
The ship of words that was floating in a dream
That can't reach you just by being seen off
"Please, stop time!"
My voice says, changing into a voice that I'm afraid even the gods
Will laugh at me for and is likely to embarrass you
On a bridge that's more crowded with people than usual,
I turn my back and run towards silence
My breathless heartbeats and footsteps... that's all I hear now
Forgetting... to wipe... the sweat that soaks through my skin away,
I'll continue running
"Isn't it a beautiful night?"
To somewhere that's not here,
As far as a place that no one knows yet,
As the whole city looks away to the sky,
We'll keep heading far away like this,
Going down along the river as far as we can
I'll never let go of this hand I've so tightly held ever again
I'm not... afraid of... even the darkness
When I'm with you, it's so dazzling
Never... ever forget
