The sun reflecting on the ground tans our sneakers
Wind from the sky, where are you going? I still can't hear your voice
In the changing panorama of this city
There are days when I feel alone, but that's part of running
I still don't understand what it is that I hold in my hand
My chest hurts, I can't breathe, but I want to protect it
It would be great if I could take all these feelings and meanings with me
Because they're connected to my future self
I squinted a little at the cloud of dust
I want to see beyond the white line, because something might change
The flowers blooming by the school building
They seem to be the same as last year, but they're not
What I've received and brought me to this place
It has no shape, it's transparent, and unyielding
"Move forward, beyond that, and reach out your hand"
That's what I feel they're telling me
Continuing to walk still scares me a bit
Repeat your first steps every day
The goal is set from the starting point
The world sometimes seems cruel
But still, I want to love it
I still don't understand what it is that I hold in my hand
My chest hurts, I can't breathe, but I want to protect it
It would be great if I could take all these feelings and meanings with me
Even the time I live in my dreams is connected to my future self
