Clouds thickened and then it was a downpour
Even though I put on new shoes,
But I'm so unlucky
And so it was from an early age
I took shelter from the rain
Under the roof of the bus stop
Just like the first time with you
The more the nostalgic memories I count,
The more I feel the tears come to me
"I thought I could overcome anything,
If I was with you"
"But I don't want to be a burden.
I'm sorry... I like you"
I never expected you to make a promise:
"I will be with you"
Either way I want
The pouring rain
To wet my cheeks and steal my tears
The twilight decorates my sadness
I stretch out my hand
To the clear sky
Did it look tragic?
To be honest, I knew
That one day such a day would come
It's useless to put on a brave face, I just want to forget...
Under the roof of the bus stop
There's too much space
I'm looking for your warmth
Even if by the power of imagination I call in a puddle
Your appearance, which I cannot touch,
In those days, when we could laugh together,
There is no return
"I want to be with you" —
I couldn't say it, because I thought I could carry it
It's all just a dream that has sunk into oblivion
I don't want to hurt you,
I want you to move ahead
There is no more motive that binds us
It started to rain again, a few seconds of watching it was enough
For the unhealed wound in my heart that I hid to make itself felt again
How could I have done better then?
Today I'm struggling with this question again...
I'm sure that love was the reason
That I was hurt, but I was glad of it
It was you who gave me hope
I never expected you to make a promise:
"I will be with you"
Either way I want
The pouring rain
To wet my cheeks and steal my tears
The twilight decorates my sadness
I stretch out my hand
To the clear sky
Even if there is no longer a hand that I can squeeze back...
