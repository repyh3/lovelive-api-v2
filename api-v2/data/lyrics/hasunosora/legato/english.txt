What I want to protect is right here
There's something in my heart I can't surrender
My dreams are like magic that can't be broken
With a flash of light, my world twinkled like the water's surface
Whether it's from joy or from pain, I can't help but be in tears
I love you so much I want to cry, so why not?
Sing a song, Sing a song
I'll hum this melody
With me, With you
Will resonate this harmony
Sing a song, Sing a song
It won't fade away forever
Your heart and my heart are linked together
If a headwind is blowing in your face,
Those wavering antenna of yours,
Let's tune-in to courage
You're never alone,
Let's be as one,
With a matching TEMPO
Let's jump onto the sheet-music
While engraving these moments of joy
Let's connect our voices to the future,
Strongly, powerfully, no matter the distance they must travel
If we have the wings of this song, we'll be alright
We can fly through the endless sky far, far away
The radiance of your feelings that can't be broken
Will light the way for us and we'll make it,
For sure, to the whereabouts of our dreams
Miracles happen when we lean on each other,
That's no lie
If you look back, the lengthening path we've walked
Never ends
A brand-new melody will continue being born
From now on until evermore...
Forever and ever more, let's send these voices
To the future
Let's connect our voices to the future,
Strongly, powerfully, no matter the distance they must travel
If we have the wings of this song, we'll be alright
We can fly through the endless sky far, far away
The radiance of your feelings that can't be broken
Will light the way for us and we'll make it,
For sure, to the whereabouts of our dreams
What I want to protect is right here
There's something in my heart I can't surrender
Let's connect our thoughts and feelings
Together as one now
