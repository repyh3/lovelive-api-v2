I am even willing to sacrifice my life
Be noble and have determination in your heart
The sun is obscured by the sensation of loss
The veil of sadness slowly fades away
The stars that are so far away from me I can no longer look for them
My vain hope has shattered
"But even so..."
I say, crossing my fingers
If I lose something, I'll get it back, even by force. I can only move forward
I am even willing to sacrifice my life
Letting the excitement stir my heart
Betting everything on the only hope I have, I'll give it my all
No matter what the end of the road
Fear and regret are a thing of the past, buried in rubble
As the heat rises, it envelops me
It is not yet possible to call this a tragedy
Like am explosion in the dark of night, our hearts rumbling can be heard
Bravely, an intense heart bats in my chest
Courageously, in my chest, my heart beats intensely
If only I could break my destiny
I'm willing to accept any consequence, no matter what it may be
It could be my salvation of my undoing
I keep feeling as if my eyelids are on fire
It was that despair that blinded me with its intensity
What brought me in the world? What's the point of going on?
I am even willing to sacrifice my life
Letting the excitement stir my heart
If only me one wish could come true
No matter where it may lead the end of the road
Be noble, carrying determination in your heart
