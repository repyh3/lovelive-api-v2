You're very much like an unpredictable day
Resorting to comparison, it's probably like watching a roller coaster
Sudden rise, rapid development, sudden descent and sharp turn
That's full speed, right? It's so much fun every time
(It's time to go) the boarding gate opens
(Let's go) the bell rings. Ride on! Ride on!
You say with a sly smile: "here I am"
Hey, can I expect something?
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
Every day is a holiday for me
Keep blowing away my common sense
Take me to your world
To where I can run faster than the wind
Ah, to where I'll scream even deeper in my heart
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
Let these special days continue
Oh Oh Oh Yeah
Giving in to fear, I close my eyes at the crucial moment
The more I learn about this feeling, the more cowardly I become
If I don't find something to hold on to, I feel like I'll just be swept away
Your hand is my protective bar, I firmly grasped it
(It's time to go) the gauge of my heart rate is rising
(Let's go) there's no going back. Ride on! Ride on!
I would like even my anxieties
To melt and disappear into the blue
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
With you they are a holiday
Nonstop from the front row, please
Take me with you to your world
To where my heart beats, so loud I can't even breathe
It's not just my aspiration anymore, so to anywhere
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
I wonder if that's not too selfish?
The present, the present, living in the present is very simple
I never, never, never forget this, so why
Do I want to become an adult as soon as possible?
Still let's spend some more time like this
"I like it" — let's cherish this feeling
If we can get through today, I'm sure
All three hundred and sixty-five days of the year will be a holiday
It's so!!!!!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
Every day is a holiday for me
Keep blowing away my common sense
Take me to your world
To where I can run faster than the wind
Ah, to where I'll scream even deeper in my heart
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
Let these special days continue
Oh Oh Oh Yeah
