Not a marionette...
"Notice me..."
I'm impatient with someone else's dream story
As soon as I stray from the ideals I believed in
I see myself as weak
I want to forget the chains that bind my heart and dance
Be myself; having the will to set myself free
The dreams I kept at a distance are brought back
A bold combination of thoughts will
Create more questions than answers
Impulsively painting the future with passion
I don't care if it's an illusion
Not to be afraid
The traffic lights turn green
I keep in mind that the choices are endless
A coincidence much like fate
The flames of emotion are flickering
I need absolute proof otherwise
I'll sleep anxiously
By my side; during the melancholic night
The light that shone reached for hope
I want to take off this fake dress
And reach out for your outstretched hand
I can't get as close as I hoped
At some point, longing will
Become an excuse to surrender
It's okay to regret
The time that's passed by me
I can break the chains that bind my heart now
Be myself; having the will to set myself free
The dreams I kept at a distance are brought back
A bold combination of thoughts will
Create unexpected miracles
Keep on searching for the answer in me
The moment I take your hand
All of my feelings overflow
Not a marionette
