Come now, let the light dwell within this empty shell
Let the light swell within me
And from beneath the moonlight, a hollow flash
Hello, if I light the gas lamp,
Will it shine for me again tonight?
I dipped my finger in indigo ink
And drew the continuation of my dream
If you let colorful rhythms ring out
Even that boiling anger will subside, tara-tta-tta-no-ta
The wishes I held in my heart have melted away
The truth is, I kept them hidden
Don't become a tengu
Adjust your tuning, and stay humble
Grant me happiness that's truly mine, I beg of you, beg of you
If we're going to burn out someday anyways,
Then we might as well just dance
Come now, let the light dwell within this empty shell
Let the light swell within me
After all this, can you still laugh?
Come now, take a look!
Let your eyes reflect it, let them reflect your troubles
I'll burn it all down
Spin on, spin on. Oh, light I've set free
Reach out, reach out to the moon
Right here, right here, I'll dance and show you
Come on over, don't be shy!
Let's bask in the thunderous applause!
Through the glass, I gaze up
At the fiery night sky and whisper to myself
"I will become the brightest star"
Ah, I'm so fed up
With this ever-changing world
Even if it's a bit of a reach, a little romance is fine, it's fine
Both praise and criticism are welcome. With gratitude and a prayerful heart,
Let us now seize our dreams!
Come now and open the door to infinity
Open the door to the future!
What is it that you see?
Come now and focus those reckless eyes of yours
And put your ingenuity to work!
I'm going to amaze you
Keep going, keep going, on the bus I jumped onto
Swaying and rocking, on to the next stop
I'll let the night breeze blow through my hair and show you a smile
Copying someone else? No thank you
My new personal best is in progress
Life is a one-time deal
Which is why I want to live it my way
Even on the nights when everything feels like it'll end halfway
And I'm about to hang my head low, I choose to dance
If you're serious, trust your heart completely
For now, it's all just empty talk
Can you say your dream out loud?
Action speaks louder than words
Connect the words, and give them form
The night is breaking
Come now, let the light dwell within this empty shell
Let the light swell within me
After all this, can you still laugh?
Come now, take a look!
Let your eyes reflect it, let them reflect your troubles
I'll burn it all down
Spin on, spin on. Oh, light I've set free
Reach out, reach out to the moon
Right here, right here, I'll dance and show you
Come on over, don't be shy!
Let's bask in the thunderous applause!
