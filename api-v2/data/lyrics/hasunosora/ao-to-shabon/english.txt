I wonder if I can create a beautiful shape
With soap liquid that reflects my gloomy face?
The words torn out by me (I have accumulated)
Because bubbles envelop even them,
I could walk without hesitation
I will give you soap bubbles
As a modest gift
With them even the unattainable blue sky is closer.
The desired future has always taught me
What it means to shine
We will put our hopes in them,
And they will soar higher than now,
Until they touch those clouds
I would like soap bubbles
That carry all my worries to have wonderful dreams
This world (this sky)
Because, even if we're apart, we're connected by them,
I wasn't scared
I will give you soap bubbles
As a modest gift
With them even the unattainable blue sky is closer
The desired future has always taught me
What it means to shine
We will put our hopes in them,
And they can go anywhere
Thanks to the fact that your gentle smile (turns into my strength)
Lights up my heart (even if there are days when I worry)
I will be fine, I think so
I will give you soap bubbles
As a modest gift
With them even the unattainable blue sky is closer
The desired future has always taught me
What it means to shine
We will put our hopes in them,
And they will soar higher than now,
Until they find themselves above those clouds
