I'm a ACE! I'm a ACE! Leave it to me
In the game, Drift Master
I slotted in the spade with a click
Oh my god, whatever, I can't wait any longer!
Oh, my ACE! Oh, my ACE!
The accelerator and brake are
Indecisive like a cypher
I've had enough - hope it just a nightmare
No problem (^_-)-☆ no problem (^_-)-☆
Just a nightmare!!!!
On the midnight highway, I stand
S・O・S - rescue me, please
Humans can't survive by themselves
Broken down... standing still, I can't move....
But day
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!
Such a safe-zone kind of life
No way
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!
My heart keeps going beyond its limits
Is it a prophetic dream or an auspicious one?
I'm breaking free, going to hell
Because that's my spade
You've already pierced my heart
So drive it deeper, crazily, into hell or hell
I'm a ACE! I'm a ACE! Leave it to me
In the game, Drift Master
I slotted in the spade with a click
Oh my god, whatever, I can't wait any longer!
Oh, my ACE! Oh, my ACE!
The accelerator and brake are
Indecisive like a cypher
I've had enough - hope it just a nightmare
No problem (^_-)-☆ no problem (^_-)-☆
Just a nightmare!!!!
Hey, if this isn't a dream after all...
No - if it is a dream, then I'll race fast enough
To drown out the screams
Surely now's the time to play the trump card
Come on - summon it!
Ask me anything, go on, command me
I am the・one・in・control
...I might not be anything great, but I can still stay with you
At the very least that's something I can do
I've come to rescue the past
That was left behind
I came to your rescue! But maybe, but maybe
You never needed saving
Maybe I'm just meddling? But it'd be, but it'd be
Foolish to just stand here and do nothing
That kind of life is complete nonsense
I'll equip myself with the latest system
The vital energy's run out
Can you believe I've stalled out like this?
If you end up hitting a dead end, then tear it down and push through!!
Wake up
Surely, it's always, it's always, it's always the same
I even see it in my dreams,
But day
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!
Such a safe-zone kind of life
No way
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!
My heart keeps going beyond its limits
Is it a prophetic dream or an auspicious one?
I'm breaking free, going to hell
Because that's my spade
You've already pierced my heart
So drive it deeper, crazily, into hell or hell
Good morning, I had a bad dream
Tell me... what was the dream about?
It was a dream where I couldn't
Go anywhere on a pitch black road
Oh, my ACE! Oh, my ACE!
Or maybe... it's reality that's the real nightmare
Ah, what a delightful nightmare
No problem (^_-)-☆ no problem (^_-)-☆
Just a nightmare!!!!
Oh, my ACE! Oh, my ACE!
my lover
