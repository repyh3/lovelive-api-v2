Chapter 1. Go action!
The day that something begins
Is the day you decide to begin
It's gonna be alright!
We'll color the sky with hope,
And fill it with dreams instead of clouds
Chance! Wink! I have camera appeal
But something's missing, just surface-level skill
Excuses mixed into the pitching
Met with sarcastic swings from behind a screen
The true identity of the icon I admired is none other than devotion
Effort's the spark that makes me glow
And with one move, I land the K.O.
It's alright, that just shows how much trust there is
Keep up the good work, and do it with care
I know, We know, You know?
Sometimes we're overkill
But, alright! I don't care!
Get ready all my babes
Let's get through this together
Shame is something you throw away in life
Invincibility is the one-and-only thing learned through losing endlessly
The best part of the dungeon is the journey
I take the experience I lack,
Forge it into strength, and sparkle
My whole body, whole soul, full power, I just wanna enjoy life!!!
That's mine; if there's one thing I can proudly use that phrase for, it's love!
If it's something you truly long for, you gotta share it at the party
If the lyrics don't carry what I want to say, then there's no point in me writing them
Blowing kisses at the standard equipment
Inherited by modernization, this is C.H.A.O.S.
I act strong because it's not forever, but that's the irony
You're actually just lonely, it clings to you like ivy
The fuel that I'm missing, it's curiosity
Get ready our dreams!
I want to be with you more
Shame is something you throw away in life
Invincibility is the one-and-only thing learned through losing endlessly
The best part of the dungeon is the journey
I take the experience I lack,
Forge it into strength, and sparkle
My whole body, whole soul, full power, I just wanna enjoy life!!!
This isn't the time to be standing still!!!
