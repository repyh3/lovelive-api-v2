Ah- The moment you look away, even though it's just a few centimeters
It seems I could reach by reaching out my arm, you're far away...
Even if I pedal hard,
I end up just not being able to overtake all of...
Ah- the days that I hate because they're too dazzling
Inside of the schoolyard
That has a dry wind blowing through it
I've been searching high and low
For the correct meaning of life
My sweat-covered back is bathed in
The sprinkler water being sprayed
If I shouted in a loud enough voice,
I believed that something would change
Where has our youth gone?
Has it gone into hiding?
Outside of the schoolyard,
No arrows are flying and I'm afraid
Even so, I grasped on tightly
The handlebars' direction
Was straight ahead of me
As I drove through
Ah- The moment you look away, even though it's just a few centimeters
It seems I could reach by reaching out my arm, you're far away...
Even if I pedal hard,
I can't overtake it, and it seems to draw to an end
Ah- I won't let you interrupt my present moment
Even my hair that's becoming ruined is beautiful
By having a little bit
Of courage in my words
I'd forgotten
My days of living in anxiety
This is what is called irony
"It might be easier to compare
Yourself with somebody else..."
I never could admit such a thing
Even now, I really don't
Understand what youth is, but
I also don't think that
I really want to know the answer
Even so, I've searched for it
The handlebars' direction
Today, too, is straight ahead,
As I'm speeding up
Ah- Even the few centimeters that were so frantic they burned my heart
Gradually pass by and become a part of the past
I press down hard on the pedal
Because I feel so happy to have overtaken you
Ah- I won't let you laugh at my present moment
This scenery has no need for words
Even though I put on the breaks,
I still feel like I’m running
That surely must have been because
My heart had been floating in the heat
I got off my bike
And the sky I saw was a blue free from a single cloud
It made me feel so sad
Ah- You can't reach even those few centimeters even if you reach out your arm,
But from the beginning, it was totally different
In other words, I was supposed to be aiming for youth,
But it seems to end in a journey of self-satisfaction
Ah- However, it won't have been in vain
The distance that we ran through is definitely there
