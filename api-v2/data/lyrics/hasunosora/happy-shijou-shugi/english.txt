I like funny things, I like cute things too.
As the pinnacle of primates, I'm for happy supremacy!
"You are really greedy!" Was this praise?
"You are incredibly selfish!" How honest^^
"Are you just playing?" I'm like that by nature.
I'm sure it's love that makes you curious♡
I run headlong towards what I want to do, this is my manifesto.
Betraying yourself is so lame that it should be illegal!
Let's raise our hands and declare here:
One, two, three, happy! I'm the representative of happiness.
Let's announce our grand plan here:
Hey-hey-oh! Our goal is happy supremacy for everyone!
"You are so free!" Not so much♪
"You are so energetic!" This is just the beginning!
"This is a flower garden!!" Isn't this wonderful?
Thanks you for the loud yells☆
Emotions are contagious.
From tingling to excitement.
Attaching a megaphone to my heart,
I want to tremble with you.
I run headlong along the path I believe in with my confident way,
Because hating yourself is much worse than being hated!
Let's amplify our voices and declare here:
L O V is wonderful! Let's explore happiness with me.
Look, your heart also makes noise, when you say "I love you", doesn't it?
Everyone, follow me! Happy supremacy for everyone!
Do you see angel wings?
YES! YES! YES! YES!
Do you feel the pleasant warmth of the sun?
YES! YES! YES! YES!
Whether it's unheard of or unexplored, it doesn't matter,
Because I'll just be number one along the way!
I don't want to live with a gloomy face.
Isn't everyone like that?
Add your smile, it will be your vote!
Let's raise our hands and declare here:
One, two, three, happy! I'm the representative of happiness.
Let's announce our grand plan here:
Hey-hey-oh! Our goal is happy supremacy for everyone!
Happy, happy, let's be happy!
