Yeah, it was decided from the start, wasn't it?
That I would meet you, and then have to say goodbye...
The rain that had just begun to fall dances atop my umbrella
As if trying to cover up the loneliness, I hum a tune
This story wasn't written for anyone else
It's for me, to read on the day I find myself in tears
Let's try tying a ribbon
Around this empty cover
I wonder what color I should go with
Let's take our time deciding
Ah, so this is what happiness feels like
I can keep facing forward... to tomorrow
I stepped beyond the schoolyard fence
Nothing had changed, except you weren't there
I welcome the morning again and again
As the world keeps on spinning around
And I have the beautiful starry sky all to myself
I have discovered something new
Would you be surprised
Or laugh if you ever found out?
Even this feels like... happiness
The last page is still far away
But I hope it's a happy ending
Let's try tying a ribbon
Around this empty cover
I wonder what color I should go with
Let's take our time deciding
Ah, so this is what happiness feels like
I can keep facing forward... to tomorrow
Let me tell you all about the little episodes
That keep adding up, when we meet again
I'm doing well... thank you
