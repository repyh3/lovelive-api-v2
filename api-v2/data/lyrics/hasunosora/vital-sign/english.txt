I need someone to help me
Quickly, quickly!
Reach out your hand
"My head hurts, my body feels heavy, and I can't sleep
I feel like I'm going to be swallowed up by the night"
"I caught a glimpse of someone else smiling and compared it to today's episode
It just made the ache deepen inside me"
I've started to doubt the saying "heaven doesn't bestow two gifts on one person"
Why? Why? Why do I keep repeating that question over and over again?
Your unheard SOS, lost before it ever reaches anyone
Let's go search for the way that will save us
Go in the direction your heart is screaming for
(An emergency call)
An inexplicable heart-pounding feeling
(People! People!)
Let's floor the accelerator and speed ahead!
It's too early to say we're too late
There's still plenty of time... Rescue!
I need someone to help me
Quickly, quickly!
Reach out your hand
"I took my anger out on you and said things I never meant
And I hate the part of me that still can't apologize"
"I've completely lost my self-respect and sense of self-worth
I can't even manage a fake smile anymore"
To those distant memories that still linger vividly, to those moments we can never go back to
Why? Why? Why? I'm starting to realizing why
I've known for a long time
Until your true form awakens once again
(An emergency call)
Sometimes it's necessary to play dumb
(People! People!)
Even if it's something I can't quite call a dream
If I can feel the desire to chase after it, then I want to try
I can see the light... Rescue!
Humans really are creatures that worry to an unhealthy degree
It's kind of a pain, but it's also endearing
Go in the direction your heart is screaming for
(An emergency call)
An inexplicable heart-pounding feeling
(People! People!)
Let's floor the accelerator and speed ahead!
It's too early to say we're too late
There's still plenty of time... Rescue!
I need someone to help me
Quickly, quickly!
Reach out your hand
