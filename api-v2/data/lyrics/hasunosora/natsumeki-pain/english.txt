There's this color and that color
Colorful colors overflow
It's our very own summertime!
Let's enjoy summertime!
When school is over, let's all gather!
Without telling the adults,
Let's have a party time!
The swimsuit hidden beneath my school uniform
Is also keeps my premonition of love secret
The splash of the waves encourages me to make merry
The message I wrote on the sandy beach has been sent
"I like you, I like you"
I wonder what to call this color? This hue of love is
So white, so radiant, with pink blended in just a bit! That's it!
It's my first time feeling this summery pain!
I can't wait for you to realize I #Love you!
Let's enjoy summertime!
The one I like is the cutest one of them all!
I've been dyed in your colors, what do you think?
Sizzling soda pop is popping in my throat!
I feel flustered; please, don't try to hurry me along!
There are still a few traces of the white sand left on my skin
What do we do next after this?
Just where will this love go?
"The choice is yours to make!"
You're the only thing that's filled my head all day, today
My sunburned skin stings just a bit, the pain courses through me! That's it!
I hope you're feeling just as
Excited as I am now
If only I could voice the patten
Of this sadness with words,
What would you do?
Please, accept my heart!
I wonder what to call this color? The feeling of being in love,
This rhythm, this beat... can only be engraved in this moment! That's it!
The colors we can't create once we've grown up,
I want to create together with you! "#I Love you!"
Let's enjoy summertime!
