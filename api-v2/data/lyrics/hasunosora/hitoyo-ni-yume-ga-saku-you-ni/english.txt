At the end of a memory (at the end of a memory)
There's a fading voice (voice)
Until it returns to nothing (until it returns to nothing)
Then why, until today (until today)
How many times has this rain become familiar to me?
Restlessness seeps into the shell I've locked myself inside
Ah, I rise on my toes stretching up towards the sun
But surely, that's okay. Because I...
Am a miracle
These building yearnings will blossom brilliantly
May our dreams bloom together for the rest of our lives
So that proof of our existence will remain here
Even as I am now, just a tiny, nameless bud
I'll sing a song of hope
To carry what came before is to journey on without end
Together with those far away, love continues to grow
The ancient past lives on forever - as does our present
Someday again... someday again
I hope you'll remember
Even if we're no longer around
In a hundred or a thousand years
Question your heart (question your heart)
Who is the one involved? (Who?)
Be prepared (be prepared)
And take one step (one step)
Ah, even if tomorrow is shrouded in mist,
Let's stay together
These budding yearnings will blossom brilliantly
May our dreams bloom together for the rest of our lives
Now, let's leave proof of our existence so that it will remain here
I'll stir my heart awake, and set my future in motion from this moment on
Even as I am now, just a tiny, nameless bud
I'll sing a song of hope
