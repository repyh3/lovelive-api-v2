There's no such thing as magic in this world
It's the kind of night where I feel like I'll freeze over, even the sky's blue comes crashing down
Always greedy, always taking, everything you call a "luxury" stands atop sacrifice
Because the heart is so empty and poor, it collapses in sorrow when it holds nothing at all
It was too sweet. Too easy. Too much, and now that I see it for what it really was... it's already too late
Ah, water, I beg of you, overflow without end and wash it all away
Now rise, as heaven and earth awaken, destruction brings rebirth
So stand tall with purity and walk with dignity
May you find peace and happiness on this endless journey to discover the true nature of this soul
Is it time now, Tír na nÓg?
If I must burn to ash, then let the sea scatter what's left of me
If you can endure it, let it nourish you,
Like the nameless heroes who came before you once did
Sin and punishment is purgatory's unending cycle
I made a vow to the eternal world, and I live for that mission
And nothing else
Now rise, as heaven and earth awaken, destruction brings rebirth
So let's fight with purity and grace
Even if this body breaks and decays... it's a price I'm willing to pay
So let's set this life ablaze
Let them laugh, let them call me foolish
I'll still raise my flag and fight for what I believe in
I'm still breathing
And living honestly
