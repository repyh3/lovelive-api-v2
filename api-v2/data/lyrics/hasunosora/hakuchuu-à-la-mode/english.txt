One, two, three
Chew, chew more and more,
After all, it's an à la mode
So soft and fluffy, eat it heartily
How do you like the taste?
"My textbook's corner has a cute heart-shaped mark in it"
"My notebook for dreamily doodling is blank"
Love's (love's?) translation,
Is there a right way to interpret it?
"Sweets are different from having a sweet flavor?"
"They can have a bitter, adult-like taste at times?"
An inexperienced (exploration!) à la mode,
I wonder, what does it taste like?
The marshmallows I chase at the windowsill
Feel so soft and fluffy!
The chime of bells reverbs
Dreaming, dreaming!
Daydreams and previews of being in love;
The things you can't even learn in class,
Shall we go search for them?
Chew, chew more and more,
After all, it's an à la mode
I still don't know yet, (Hey!!) but I wanna know (Hey!!)
I want to dream with more sugar
I want to give you love
In two equal parts!
So soft and fluffy, (Hey!) eat it heartily (Hey!!)
How do you like the taste? (Yummy?)
(Midday à la mode)
"Does it taste sweet and sour?"
(Midday à la mode)
Served upon a cute tea stand
(Midday à la mode)
"My heart pounds with excitement for the first bite"
(Midday à la mode)
The moment I stuffed my cheeks,
I awoke from the dream
(One) A leveled cup full of excitement,
(Two) A suitable amount of heart-fluttering to taste,
(Three) Add one and two in the shape of a heart,
Stir it well
(Four) Sugar is three times what you think it is,
(Five) It's hot, so let step four cool,
(Six) If you can't wait and bake 'til golden brown...
Knew it, I failed again!?
This love recipe is incomplete,
That one day I'll be able to taste sweet love,
I'm dreaming, dreaming!
In my broad daylight daydream,
I'm yearning for the magic
That will melt my heart!
Chew, chew! I want to chew more
Of this dreamt up à la mode
It's just so sweet and so salty,
Maybe a floating sensation
Love isn't something you make,
It's something you fall into...
Inside the classroom, inside my dreams,
I wonder, will I ever find it?
Chew, chew more and more,
After all, it's an à la mode
I still don't know yet, (Hey!!) so I can't stop! (Hey!!)
I want to dream only in the daylight!
Love is a taste of the unknown!
Shall I perhaps share it with you?
So soft and fluffy, (Hey!) eat it heartily! (Hey!!)
How do you like the taste? (Yummy!)

Served upon a cute tea stand

"I'm saving the main course for last"
(Midday à la mode)
Speaking of, what's an à la mode
In the first place anyway...?
Well, I mean, it's a "taste of love"
Can you eat "love"...?
