In the dim light of dawn
A breeze rustled the grass and trees
It was a time when two worlds intertwined
I found a cicada shell
Wet with morning dew
Hey, where are you shining now?
A new dawn, the sky is awakening
And the world is now set in motion
Every day always begins with "Good morning!"
It's a password bundled in kindness
I wonder what kind of day awaits me?
I can rejoice in the fact
That my ordinary everyday life continues
What I take for granted is a miracle
Someone's alarm can be heard
Ringing from afar on the street corner
I have a premonition that a noisy future is approaching
Today we played catch-up again
Until our shadows began to stretch
Hey, what are you planning?
Shall we go?
The smell of the earth (the sound of the trees)
Leave a bookmark in my memory
There is not a single day without something happening
I take a deep breath and exhale
One by one
My treasures (keep on adding up)
While memories (beat)
Their quiet (rhythm)
The morning sun smiles at me
New song, I'll sing along with the babbling brook
Let's make a small detour along the way
Every day always begins with "Good morning!"
It's a password bundled in kindness
I wonder what kind of day awaits me?
I can rejoice in the fact
That my ordinary everyday life continues
What I take for granted is a miracle
The landscape is painted blue
Hello, good day
