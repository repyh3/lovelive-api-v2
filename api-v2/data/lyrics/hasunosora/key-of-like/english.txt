Inside the toy box, filled to the brim with "fun",
A little universe spreads out (shimmering)
What kind of surprises are waiting?
Hey, let's open that key together (and see for ourselves)
A voice sings like a prayer
A night where we dance along the traces of tears (even through misunderstandings)
Like jewels decorating the sky
An irreplaceable story, shining together on our stage
Each piece connecting one by one
Even the biggest ambitions
Feel like they can come true
When we share the same dream
Facing "love" can make us a little scared
Hating our own weaknesses at times
But the struggle means hope still remains
So let's unlock that hidden key too (and move forward)
The guiding light is your smile —
So let's start running
An invisible glory, the phrases we've woven together
Let's treasure each and every one
Even if our tempos don’t match
We're still heading for the same goal
None of it was for nothing
Doubt and conflict turn into clouds
Worries and regrets bring the rain
But we'll keep running until the sky clears
An irreplaceable story, shining together on our stage
As long as you're here, there's nothing to fear
Even the biggest ambitions
Feel like they can come true
When we share the same dream
We will definitely make the world
Fall in love with us!
