Immerse yourself in strawberry milk, and let's have sweet dreams together
C'mon, come this way - to where I am
Go on, open the door, and I'll make you forget all about your everyday life
Don't worry about the dress code, I'll escort you just as you are
Trying to hide your embarrassment? It's sweet... so don't turn those eyes away from me
Look at me, your very own Prince Charming, standing right in front of you
Place a bright red passion onto a pure white heart
See? They're mixing, they're blending
Gradually, it's changing, it's shifting
Melting together, fall in love
Maybe this really is fate, so c'mon, just admit it, more and more
Say you love me, you like me, you like me, you like me, say it
(Baby, say "I love you")
Immerse yourself in strawberry milk, and let's have sweet dreams together
As if repeating my first love, I fall in love again and again
C'mon, come this way - to where I am
Are you trying to make me jealous? It's not like you to play those kinds of games
What words do you want me to whisper in your ear?
More dangerous than biting into a poisonous apple
See? I already know, I already know
Gradually, you're getting hooked, you're getting hooked
It's too late, fall in love
Maybe you could call it being a little mean, but I want to fluster you, more and more
Say you love me, you like me, you like me, you like me, say it
(Baby, say "I love you")
Immerse yourself in strawberry milk, and let's have sweet dreams together
C'mon, come this way - to where I am
I won't hand you over to anyone
Now, set aside that ticking clock
You might just be my Cinderella, I only hope this magic never fades
Say you love me, you like me, you like me, you like me, say it
(Baby, say "I love you")
Immerse yourself in strawberry milk, and let's have sweet dreams together
Our promise is our glass slipper, let's keep it safe and treasured
Come see me again - come to where I am
