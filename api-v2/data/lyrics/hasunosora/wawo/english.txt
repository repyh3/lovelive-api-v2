WA! WA! WA! WA! WA!
WA! WA! WA! WA! WA! WA! WA!
WA! WA! WA! WA! WA!
WA! WA! WA! WA! WA! WA! WA!
WA! WA! This is exciting, this is wonderful
WA! WA! WA! Let's stand in a circle, dogs and cats too
WA! WA! Wa-ha-ha, this is wonderful
WA! WA! Wa-wa-wa, WAWO! WAWO!
WAWO!
Draw a circle the size you like
Draw a face, as your heart tells you
You can't add a cross,
Even if you're crying or angry
It's wonderful, when you hesitate even for a moment
It's a gift to worry about others
Come on, let's go, yeah, take even the things you hate with you
(Take your kindness with you)
WAWO! WAWO! The globe is so big (so big)
It's full of people and things I don't know
WAWO! WAWO! United and spread our arms, can we hug?
Let's check (we can do it)
Even if our words, lifestyles, and dreams are different,
WAWO! WAWO! I won't leave you alone
Come here, I'm coming for you
Let's all form a circle
WA! WA! WA! WA! WA!
WA! WA! WA! WA! WA! WA! WA!
Even if I sweat and stumble,
If I then go outside, ready to cry,
That might be a success
I will enjoy life, I won't give up on it
I heard that cells grow for three months
Re-analysis: has anything changed since then?
Come on, let's go with a "come what may" expression
(While updating our regrets and failures)
WA! WA! WA! Even when the day of parting comes,
WA! WA! WA! So that you don't forget everything that was
WA! WA! WA! Become a crocodile
Always laugh with a smile from ear to ear (you can laugh too)
WA! WA! WA! WA! WA!
WAWO! WAWO! The globe is so big (so big)
It's full of people and things I don't know
WAWO! WAWO! United and spread our arms, can we hug?
Let's check (we can do it)
Even if our words, lifestyles, and dreams are different,
It becomes a big circle (I know, I know, it's gradually changing)
Even if it's just a belief (if we implement it, it will become reality) no doubt
WAWO! WAWO! I won't leave you alone
Come here, I'm coming for you
Let's all form a circle
