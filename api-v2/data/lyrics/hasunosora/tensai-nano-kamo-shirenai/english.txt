Do you want me to give you a sign now?
Perhaps sitting at a desk is also important,
But we're in the mood to go somewhere
Yes, a school trip is also a great lesson,
But allow us to take a walk!!
Movies, manga, game center, karaoke –
I want to visit each of these places
It's not fun, you're wrong, I'm just passionate about research
Maybe we are geniuses
All we have are opportunities
If we find something we like,
We'll instantly become like the masters of this craft
Maybe we are geniuses
We're just poorly compatible with textbooks
Because in the future we'll make a name for ourselves,
We can't make decisions based on tests alone
This place, this place and that, the clock goes in a circle
Hey, it's almost closing time
And still a mountain, a mountain, a mountain of everything left unfinished
It looks like it surpasses Everest
Add to the pumpkin pudding apple pie,
Macarons and sweet potatoes
When we use our brain, we also burn calories
This is an investment in the future, do you know this?
Maybe we are geniuses.
We ourselves don’t know this yet,
But maybe the future in the role of adventurers or inventors awaits us
We are not good at walking in a column. Once you let your guard down, we'll turn back.
Even if we make an supreme effort, only our legs will get tired, so let's go at our own pace
Movies, manga, game center, karaoke –
I want to visit each of these places
I want to have fun, I admit it,
But this is our training, are you ready for this?
Maybe we are geniuses
All we have are opportunities
If we find something we like,
We'll instantly become like the masters of this craft
Maybe we are geniuses
We're just poorly compatible with textbooks
Because in the future we'll make a name for ourselves,
We can't make decisions based on tests alone
