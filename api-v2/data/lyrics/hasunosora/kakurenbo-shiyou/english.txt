Let's turn off our phones on the count of three
Put down our earphones and feel light again
Without making any plans, let's just start walking
Taking the hidden paths that don't appear on any map
The scent of the forest spreads all around
The soft earth sinks beneath our steps
The trees applaud as the wind dances
And the birds sing along with our humming
I feel a little tired from these busy days
There are just too many difficult things
Can't we stay as kids forever?
Laughing, covered in mud...
"Just kidding"
Let's carve this day into our hearts
Build a secret base just for us
I hope it becomes your safe place
"Are you ready?" "Yeah, I'm ready."
Let's play hide-and-seek until our tears dry
We jump past
A giant spider's web
Say goodbye to the lively little fish
Looking down at the tiny town below
Somehow, just a little, everything feels okay
Even though we all have to grow up someday
Let's keep our secret words just between us
I hope they always protect you
"Are you ready?" "Yeah, I’m ready."
Let's play hide-and-seek until we can be gentle again
Let's carve this day into our hearts
Build a secret base just for us
I hope it becomes your safe place
"Are you ready?" "Yeah, I’m ready."
Let's play hide-and-seek until our tears dry
Watching the contrails in the sky
Feeling a little bittersweet
But then our stomachs growl
That's just so like us
Shall we go home? What's for dinner?
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la la...
La la la la la la, la la la, la la...
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la la...
La la la la la la, la la la, la la...
