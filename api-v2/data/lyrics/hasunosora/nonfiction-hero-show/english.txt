Have you been waiting for
The heroes to appear, good kids?
Then let's start
Mira-Pa's show!
Love, justice, caramel, dreams, courage and a cafe latte,
We need them to become stronger. Nothing will start until the stomach is full.
A cloak to fly through the sky and a belt to transform,
I don't need them, so just give me a microphone
A true protagonist will never harm anyone
I'll make the whole world so excited
That everyone will just forget about the bad things
Even if for example we only have one second,
I'm sure that we'll be able to completely defeat evil
Who is this? Who is this?
By becoming the object of rumors, you become their prisoner
So, by starting and creating nonfiction,
We'll stubbornly run through it with a smile
Please, enjoy the miracle born from the hard work of
Our loud voices from this small stage
Today we'll sing again with enthusiasm
This masterpiece that makes the whole universe cry
Have you been waiting for us, good kids?
Then let's start
Are you ready, good kids?
Let's shout together
The red lamps are on, I've run out of energy, what should I do?
There's nothing you can do, I just need to take a break! Health comes first.
It's not good to drink too many energy drinks or work too hard
God's purpose and a transformation machine,
I don't need them, so just call me
Remember that your presence is a switch to awakening mode
Let's make this planet burst out laughing
Until the steam begins to rise around it
Let's try to do the impossible
I'm sure that contrary to expectations we'll be able to do this, while we're not alone
Who is this? Who is this?
By becoming the object of rumors, you become their prisoner
So, by starting and creating nonfiction,
We'll stubbornly run through it with a smile
Please, enjoy the miracle born from the hard work of
Our loud voices from this small stage
Today we'll sing again with enthusiasm
This masterpiece that makes the whole universe cry
Don't hide it, send a SOS signal
We have been friends since the moment we met
You don't like doing things just for show,
I'm the same of course
I don't know what's wrong with saying
That you cherish what you cherish
That's enough, that's enough.
We can start right now, so please love and favor
Who is this? Who is this?
By becoming the object of rumors, you become their prisoner
So, by starting and creating nonfiction,
We'll run through it with a smile further and further
Real madness, it's just madness
I feel embarrassed, when people praise me like that
There is a feeling that a hidden ball,
Flying from the rearguard to the front edge, is always late
Do you think there are times when a small flame
Can shed more light on someone than the sun?
Involving the entire universe in this, today we're opening,
With enthusiasm again, this attention-grabbing work to the public
Have you been waiting for us, good kids?
Then let's start
Are you ready, good kids?
Let's shout together
Thank you, good kids!
