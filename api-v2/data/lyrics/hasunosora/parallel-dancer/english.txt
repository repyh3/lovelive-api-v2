This city that's surrounded by planets
Is a skyscraper colored with stardust
I want to dance until dawn, not caring what the time is
Step, step, keep going
The costumes aligned in the show windows
Make me dream of various kinds of things
Shall we take a peek into the world through the glass
Of my fantasy?
You’re free to cast up a wish
All dressed up in glitter,
Tonight, I'm a parallel dancer
I’m beautiful (lovely)
And so gorgeous (and there's still more to come)
Pretty please, tell me, are you ready? (Okay)
Fluttering her wings high in the sky
And making all your wishes come true, that dancer
Is purely (an image)
An unscientific (ideal image)
It’s alright if it's fantasy (that's right)
I'd like to try on even every last one
Of the dresses of light that have been woven
In the place where shooting stars rained down from the sky
Please, please, show them to me
I'll change as soon as I've met
My high-tension self
Shall we return to the world the real me
Had been existing in?
Now, I know
Even if I don't twinkle so brightly,
I'll always be a parallel dancer
My heart is (unstable)
But, you know, (there's still more to come)
So, I'll just keep on moving forward! (Okay!)
Shining brighter than anyone else
And engulfing even the universe, that dancer
Is purely (an image)
That's to say, (an ideal image)
It's a good thing if you're growing (yeah, I guess)
The gloom and doom is blown away
Tonight, I'm a parallel dancer
I’m beautiful (lovely)
And so gorgeous (and there's still more to come)
Come on and let's dance! Are you ready? (Okay)
Don't stop the music
See her creating the future, that dancer
From here on out (I wonder where)
Can we go? (Let's have fun!)
It's beyond just fantasy! (That's right!)
