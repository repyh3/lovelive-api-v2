Hey, do you want to go back to sleep for another 5 minutes?
Even though I say that, I've never once woken up in just 5 minutes
Hey, should I go with twin-tails or a ponytail?
And then, of course, I always end up cutting it way too close
Question my heart
Are you okay? Really?
There's no problem? You know?
It's totally hectic right now
You're making me go crazy again today
You keep pestering me with whatever random stuff you want to say
But you're always on my side, and the one who understands me best
Well then, I guess it can't be helped
I'm counting on you
Hey, that girl's making a gloomy face again!
It would be easier if she could talk to someone about her worries, but...
Hey, sometimes I wonder if I'm just being a bother!
But even then, I still can't just look the other way
If I can't be flawless, then at least I can start with
A cheerful good morning!
Question my heart
I'm okay! Really!
There's no problem! You know!
When you let go of all your worries, you're invincible
You're making me go crazy again today
You keep pestering me with whatever random stuff you want to say
But you're always on my side, and the one who understands me best
Well then, I guess it can't be helped
I'm counting on you
Today, once again, you're testing me
Acting like you're spoiling me, but really just being a tease
But you're the one always right beside me, showing me the way
It hasn't gone unnoticed...
So for that, thank you
