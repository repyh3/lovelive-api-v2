Pushing through the crowd and stepping over puddles
I opened my umbrella in a world of drizzling rain
On the hill, three-leaf clovers bloom
But today, having never learned my lesson, I search for a four-leaf again
Even though I feel like I'm about to be buried under established norms,
I push through them in search of a suitable form for me
"Love", "hope", "trust", plus something else
I'm here, I hear you, but I can't find you
Maybe being shy is a sign of good luck
Stay where you are, I promise I'll find you:
My own lucky clover
A crown of flowers is better than any honor
I'm sure it suits me better
So that it doesn't wither, I want to become stronger
This wish of mine is already sprouting
It seems that it's easy to give up, but in reality, it's quite difficult
It hurts more than when you step over yourself
I can't lie to myself
The rain stopped a long time ago
But I completely forgot about it
Before I knew it, the sun had set, and I was even confused
But the sky with its iridescent colors is so beautiful
Where is it? Maybe it was in my heart
I kept looking for it all this time...
I'm here, I hear you, but I can't find you
Maybe being shy is a sign of good luck
Stay where you are, I promise I'll find you:
My own lucky clover
Now I'm blooming in my own way
