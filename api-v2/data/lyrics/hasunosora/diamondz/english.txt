Surprisingly, it's okay
Even in adversity, I don't care
Sturdy emotions are like diamonds in the rough
I'm totally fine
I'm not pushing myself or anything
But, there have been days where I've been hurt by pretending to be strong
The light of rebellion shines
So tell me, what is the power?
Even pressure is a key to evolution
Is what shatters dreams of the past
A new dream? Ironic, isn't it?
Bring on the irrational - all right
The abrasives that polish
An evolving diamond are love and regret
I'm so sick of it and now, my eyes are
Shining endlessly, reflecting the future
I want to believe, I want to believe
I turned to ashes, I was serious
Hey, don't say it's impossible, I'll change
And show you the chapter of recrystallization
It's completely fine
Your experience and hard work
Will never fade away
Passion sets my spirit aflame,
I care not for the talent or giftedness
This feeling that can make me burn with passion
Now, I've come to like it
Even the noisy outside voices are
Polishing agents, so give me more
Now, with my chest held high, facing forward, unshaken
Resolve and ego scatter in dazzling reflections
What do I want, what do I really want?
As for those losing competitions - I have no interest
Hey, don't cool down, don't stop - I feel like I can go on
Just like this, into an unforeseen chapter
The light of rebellion shines
So tell me, what is the power?
Basking in pressure, a sign of change appears
We'll take over every throne in a bold and splendid style
It'll be a shocking parade
Into a beautiful world
The abrasives that polish
An evolving diamond are love and regret
I'm so sick of it and now, my eyes are
Shining endlessly, reflecting the future
I want to believe, I want to believe
But I was so serious, I turned to ashes
Hey, don't say it's impossible, I'll change
And show you the chapter of recrystallization
