Hey!
An order just came in, huh? Oh no!
The chef is still on vacation
Looking around, the one who clearly looks bored is obviously me
What other ingredients are there besides beans? I guess there's the mixed meat...?
Wait, is the ground meat sneaking off to go on a secret date!?
This recipe is a bit too poetic for me
(Very delicious, very delicious)
You're the wild cowboy
And I'm just the waitress, it's go time!
Kitchen-style hospitality
This is a famous custom in the Wild West
Chili con carne? It sounds like gibberish...
And we didn't have enough spice powder so it's tasting weak
Take that "I want you" meat smell
And season it with love's bold pepper
Chili con carne? Chili beans?
Take off the extra and it's just "chilibin", easy!
Okay, I've got it!
In drips the secret potion... wait, is that possible?
I wander thousands of miles,
Aiming for the instant riches
What's finally come into view, is it heaven?
I can't take it, it smells so good
(Very dangerous, very dangerous)
Got any more, angel?
Because this warm chili con carne hits the spot
I'm being served with hospitality in this sketchy kitchen
What happens after that is anyone's guess
Aiming straight at
Each other's foreheads, baby
(Chili con carne)
If I can't capture your heart, then I'll just shoot it instead
(A swarm of monsters!?)
Ride with me, you wild buffalo!
This is madness! Oh my god!
With minced and julienne cuts
This maiden's heart is scattered in pieces
Chili powder is like dust and dirt
That doesn't even catch your eye so I'll just (Cry)
Chili pepper; "super mad" doesn't even
Begin to cover how spicy this is
Because when it's real, there's nothing sweet about it
Too late! Time to boogie-woogie!
Chili con carne? Chili beans?
Take off the extra and it's just "chilibin", easy!
No, no only "okay" is an acceptable answer
I was gonna win their stomach... but wait, what!? I won their life...!
