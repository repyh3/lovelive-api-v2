Let's go and check it out, behind the sunglasses
What color is everyone's summer?
Baby come on! Bask in the sunshine and go!
Very! It's a clear sky - the sky's pure blue!
Very! Welcome to the white sandy beach
Put on your swimsuit, put on your flip-flops!
This is nothing less than paradise
Very! You are so bold and fearless
Come on, bit by bit, step out from under the trees
Peeking out, as if wanting to get a suntan
COCONUT - hidden within those letters
Are the connections and bonds between others
After all, everyone's fun
Is the best - the very best
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Let's have fun in the summer and enjoy the scorching heat
(Woah, woah, whoa)
Jump! Jump! Jump!
I'm in a tropical mood and it feels like
Summer is here to stay!
Even more! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Let's play in this moment and enjoy the excitement
(Woah, woah, whoa)
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Let this become an unforgettable memory
A super COCO-summer!
If you get (if you get) a little tired
Right away (right away) tell me, okay?
If it's worry, then No! If it's trust, then So!
Let's just take a nap together
COCONUT - I love the smell of them
It feels, it feels like I could see sweet dreams
The best, the very best - what lies ahead
Has yet to come, it's only just beginning
All right, ride the wave!
Come on, you too! Come on, you too! Come on, you too!
(Yes! Yes! Yes!)
Mr. Crocodile, Mr. Shark, even the Chow Chow
(Yes! Yes! Yes!)
Woah-oh (Yes!) Woah-oh (Yes!)
One, two, one, two, three
If you're ready to have fun...
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Let's have fun in the summer and enjoy the scorching heat
(Woah, woah, whoa)
Jump! Jump! Jump!
I'm in a tropical mood and it feels like
Summer is here to stay!
Even more! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Let's play in this moment and enjoy the excitement
(Woah, woah, whoa)
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Let this become an unforgettable memory
A super COCO-summer!
Boom! Boom! Everybody Boom! (Yeah)
You! You! You, let's play too (Oh)
Boom! Boom! Everybody Boom! (Yeah)
Come on, let's get fired up!
(Woah-oh, woah-oh)
