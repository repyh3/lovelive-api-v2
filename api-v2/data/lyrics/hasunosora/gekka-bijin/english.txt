Grace, Delight, Rejoicing... Darkness
(Make a moment last forever)
Yeah, I'm a night queen
(Make a moment last forever)
If I turn both dryness and moisture into nourishment for my roots and leaves,
Then I'll stand on stage
In a single firece, beautiful moment... I burn bright as sparks scatter
With great honor
Even if it blooms for only a moment,
Its scent, the finest, lingers on eternally
Like a spell beneath a hazy moon, this is our perfect night
The morning sun shines through the curtain,
Telling me it was all just a dream
Standing in the brilliance of the light
Is a captivating flower that dances true to itself
Wind blows high
It's like a blue bird
The moon is down
I refuse to let you say the ending was the most beautiful part
In the frozen winter, I trembled with my head down, nearly withered,
Still, I stand one edge
With limbs that had begun to wither once more (Stand against a destined fate)
Let's dance until dawn
The flowers dance, the birds soar, the wind joins them too
Radiant, graceful in form, a utopia, the fleetingness of existence
I don't want to regret anything when I wither away
When the stars drifted into sleep at daybreak
My chest tightened and something in me quietly ached
Even after I wake up, I won't forget
The morning sun shines through the curtain,
A sign that the dream is stepping into the spotlight
What truly shines is the way you live
Is a captivating flower that dances true to itself
Wind blows high
It's like a blue bird
The moon is down
I refuse to let you say the ending was the most beautiful part
