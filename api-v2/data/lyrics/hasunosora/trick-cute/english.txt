A determined and different eye make-up than usual
(It's a strange magic that only girls can use)
I feel like a black cat, a bit capricious
(Just for today, I'm going to have a special kind of fun)
Let's have a party filled with treats
Chocolates and candies are dancing
The fun is about to begin, isn't it?
I'll become someone you've never seen before
Trick & Cute, I can do anything
I'll smile, twirl, and shake things up
Let's do all kinds of cute things
I'll make the whole world fall in love with me
Shalala, serve yourself a cup of tea
Shubiduba, c'mon let's start
With some exciting plans right now
Shalala, feel free to do so
Shubiduba, even the cats are laughing
The magical moment is about to begin
On my cheeks, there's a special blush, sweeter than ever
(With fairy powder that fulfills any wish)
Even the magic mirror falls in love with me
(It's the beginning of a wonderland)
After getting ready, let's head into the town
Let's bring the mischievous cat along too
If you're mean to me, I'll start to cry!
Even the demons will get into trouble
Trick & Sweet, let's sparkle
Let's be silly, ask for affection, captivate each other
Let's do all kinds of fun things
I'll take over all the sighs and hearts
Let's have a party filled with treats
Angels and demons are dancing
The fun is about to begin, isn't it?
I'll become someone you've never seen before
Trick & Cute, I can do anything
I'll smile, twirl, and shake things up
Let's do all kinds of cute things
I'll make the whole world fall in love with me
Trick & Sweet, let's sparkle
(Let's sparkle)
Let's be silly, ask for affection, captivate each other
(Captivate each other)
Let's do all kinds of fun things
(Let's do it)
I'll take over all the sighs and hearts
Shalala, serve yourself a cup of tea
Shubiduba, c'mon let's start
With some exciting plans right now
Shalala, feel free to do so
Shubiduba, even the cats are laughing
The magical moment is about to begin
It's the beginning
