Ah, today's just the worst and I messed up,
But for now, I'll sing anyways (OK!)
Tomorrow's gonna be happy, and the day after? Happi-py!
Next week will be an even more top-tier Happy
(I totally forgot all the bad stuff)
Having an emoty head is great! Yeah!!!!
Just for a moment,
Let's raise our loudest voices, together
C'mon! I don't really feel it,
I don't have time, but it doesn't matter!
Well then, come on, come on
Let's make a good encounter happen in this moment
Sunday, Monday - a super awesome one day!
Puppy-dog, kitty-cat
Super-duper cute from head to toe
Ah, everything's jumbled up,
Let's dance amidst the chaos
In sweet bedding, if I swing just right, surely
Tomorrow will be, oh! An upgraded version of today
From A to Wa, I've heard it all,
Oh dear, how awful, you're not even subtle
But wasted money, wasted steps, all that effort for nothing,
And no path ahead? LOL. Bring it on!
Wanna eat some meaningless-flavored gummies or something?
(The fun never fades 'cause it's forever)
Just riding on this wave is perfect!
(For now, for now)
One times one is still one and being alone is such a waste
(For now, for now) If you just give it a try, things will work out somehow - Que será, será
(For now, for now) As for the heavy textbooks...
(For now, for now) Well, let's just set that aside
Having an empty head is great!
(Totally!) Yeah!!!!
