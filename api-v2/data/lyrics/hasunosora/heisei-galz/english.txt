Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
On New Year's Eve, around 10:40 in the morning
The genius monkey finally got started
Upright walking
A milestone in Earth's history
Not yet? Not yet?
The galz aren't here yet!?

Keep your looseness to the socks only
My heart shines darker and stronger than my tan
Sup
And not, it's not the sausage
A wannabe gal? Total vibe-kill
I'm not telling the adults!!!!
Compared to Australopithecus
Our evolution is much faster
I wanna stay bubbly and cute~
Pappappaa yappa pappa yappa
Pappappaa yappa pappa yappa
Pappappaa yappa pappa yappa

From Heisei to Reiwa
From fashion to mindset
Our sub-divided identities is
A revived legacy!
If you tap your pockets, out comes the gal・gal・galz
A broken biscuit just turns into tart crust
From Heisei to Reiwa
From fashion to mindset
Anyway, I honestly don't even know what I'm saying
YEAH~
Ugyarus are the fishing galz
Nogyarus are camping-in-the-wild galz
Gyarumsar is totally in northern Iran
Trying to divide 4.6 billion years by 365
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's wrong..
Compared to Australopithecus
Our height is juuust barely taller
I wanna stay all smug and showy~
Doyadoya ya doyadoya
Doyadoya ya doyadoya
Doyadoya ya doyadoya
Doyadoya ya doyadoya
From Heisei to Reiwa
From fashion to mindset
Our sub-divided identities is
A revived legacy!
If you tap your pockets, out comes the gal・gal・galz
Tap it too far, and it drops・out of・sight
If your metaphors get too complicated, they turn into nonsense
Somehow my claps always fall on the offbeat
Everything on the path to evolution is great
Rather than complaining, start with OK, all good!
Compared to Neanderthals
We've got way less muscle power
I kinda wanna try going all bubbly-buff~

If you tap your pockets, out comes the gal・gal・galz
A broken biscuit just turns into tart crust
The capital of Turkey is totally in Istanbul
Turkish ice cream is sold without fooling around
Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
Born with a cry, we're the Heisei Galz
