Because I want to be the person that I like from all sides,
The first thing I'll do is audition with a smile through the glass
The first stage of selection has already passed. Now I can only firmly believe in myself and move on
As my number one fan
We are free to dream as we please
There is no need to be ashamed of this
I will shout loudly:
Da-da-da-da-da!
"With all my body and soul!" — this is my motto, I encourage myself with it
"This is definitely impossible" — such thoughts only inflame me even more and more
Just do it clean and right
Just do it and strengthen your intentions
Just do it, cause it's so much fun
Just do it right now
One more time, one more time if you can overcome your weaknesses,
I will praise you properly that you are great
Although you may encounter troubles, emergencies and efforts that are not rewarded,
I'll just hug you tight
I have a pain in my chest,
But I won't let myself be deceived
I will shout randomly:
Da-da-da-da-da!
"Positive until the last!" — this is also my motto, I encourage myself with it
It's on the worst days that I want to smile at least a little
Beware, identity established by someone else
Is not about me, look straight at me
I don't complain about anything, but, once I decide on something,
I can be quite stubborn
From complete combustion for me
Is still very, very, very far
"With all my body and soul!" — this is my motto, I encourage myself with it
"This is definitely impossible" — such thoughts only inflame me even more and more
Just do it clean and right
Just do it and strengthen your intentions
Just do it, cause it's so much fun
Just do it right now
You too join me!
