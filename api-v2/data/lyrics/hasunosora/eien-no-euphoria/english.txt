We have nothing to fear anymore, so let's go!
This road I've been aiming for was a dream,
So far and so steep, that it made my legs wobble
But you, who believed in me, was always there,
Therefore I was able to become stronger
Standing on a bridge in the twilight sky
In my heart that seemed to be about to stop
I heard your voice:
Raise your face (raise your face), so one more time...
Euphoria! If my feelings pulsate
Always because of that smile of yours,
I can start to run ahead
Euphoria! Let's sing, making our hearts tremble for the future
This is the story of how we met by chance
The moment we become one we have nothing to fear anymore
So let's go!
As the sky begins to drizzle, chances and pinches
Always arise suddenly on a whim
But the warmth of your hand outstretched to me, I'm sure
That it created a bond that will last forever
Looking at the stars, peeking through the clouds,
I offered my desires to God
I'm sure that you're the same as me,
But let's keep it a secret (let's keep it a secret), I hope they come true
Euphoria! Because the feelings that bind us
Keep talking to you all the time
Please, listen to them
Euphoria! Let's go to a place filled with smiles
Whatever happens, everything will be alright
Even on the nights, when you can't get up,
We're looking at the same sky, so smile!
If you tell me that there's as much pain (as much pain)
As there is joy (if you tell me that)
I'll never get lost again
Someday the road will surely open to us
Euphoria! If my feelings pulsate
Always because of that smile of yours,
I can start to run ahead
Euphoria! Because the feelings that bind us
Keep talking to you all the time
Please, listen to them
Euphoria! Let's sing, making our hearts tremble for the future
This is the story of how we met by chance
The moment we become one we have nothing to fear anymore
So let's go!
