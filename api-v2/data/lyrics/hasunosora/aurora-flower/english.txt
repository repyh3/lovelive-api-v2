I want to always believe that
Despite all my weaknesses and doubts
I will smile at the future and talk about it
My present is like the dream I saw that day
As the seasons change, the meaning of our meetings also changes
We begin to treasure them very much
Leaping over them and leaving them behind
Everyone, shine. Shine, so that there are no regrets left
If we connect our hearts, we will shine,
Becoming the aurora at the edge of the sky
Light and sound bloom in my heart. I can't hold back the feelings I want to express.
I won't give up, because the chances are not zero
I won't give up, so let's seriously soar through these moments
If I hold on to my present, past and future now,
Yeah, I think I'll like myself for not giving up
Because we're all...trying to make our dreams come true
Doing our best is why our flower is blooming
As we all chase after our dreams,
We're filled with excitement for another day, blooming in all our glory
The hope we sing about with all our hearts, let it reach every corner of the world
My heart is dancing with light and sound. Let's all sing here, right here
Is it beautiful and fleeting, like the aurora?
But, but I won't disappear
I want to always, always bloom lushly. I want to bloom.
I want us to hold hands, smiling that we're the best
I think I got sweat in my eyes...
I'm grateful for my present, past and future now
If I can be the one who doesn't give up, I can still go far
I won't give up, because the chances are not zero
I won't give up, so let's seriously soar through these moments
If I hold on to my present, past and future now,
Yeah, I think I'll like myself for not giving up
