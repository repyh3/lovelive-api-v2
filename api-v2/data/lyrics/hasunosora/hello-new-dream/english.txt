I always
Want my heart to keep fluttering
Isn't it great to feel excited all the time?
Look, I think something's calling me
Hello, new dream!
Hey, have you asked your heart:
"What do I want to do right now?"
I wants to search for
The kind of love that feels like me
I keep being told I can do anything,
But it's not that easy
Who needs the "right" answer, anyway?
Let's keep dreaming again and again
I wonder
What kind of excitement is waiting for me tomorrow?
I wonder what kind of excitement I'll encounter
Because I want to discover something new
I'm never just me
I'm a part of us
That's why I know we can get through anything
If we could come together and become one
We'll keep on sparkling more and more, right?
Hello, my dream!
Hello, new dream!
Hey, do you remember the excitement
From the moment it all begun?
If you ever get lost, just try to remember that
If something catches your interest,
You've got to try it no matter what it is!
Failure is experience too!
And you can always count on me to give you that push forward
As the seasons pass us by
The shape of each of our dreams changes as well
Petals can't become a flower just by themselves
So let's bring everyone's dreams together and make a big flower bloom!
I wonder
What kind of excitement is waiting for me tomorrow?
I wonder what kind of excitement I'll encounter
Because I want to discover something new
I'm never just me
I'm a part of us
That's why I know we can get through anything
If we could come together and become one
We'll keep on sparkling more and more, right?
Hello, new dream!
I'm right here beleving in you!
Hello, my dream! Hello, your dream!
Hello... new dream!
