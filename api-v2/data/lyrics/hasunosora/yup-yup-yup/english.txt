Hey, there are times I just can't help
Feeling depressed, but
If you, only you, and me, only me
Are together, we'll have special days
In the middle of this city,
A drizzle of rain gently falls
I wonder how I'll ever be able to
Hey, shine brighter and brighter
Ah, the world will keep on moving
Beyond this confusion Someday
For sure, it'll be alright.
Tomorrow will be sunny!
So, smile! Hallelujah! Yup! Yup!
Exciting, isn't it?
Yup! Yup! Yup!
Yeah, it'll be alright.
Tomorrow will be sunny
So, let's dance
I want to bloom, I have high hopes,
Let me, let me
Rush and run about everyday
LALALALALA
It's the best! It's the best, very best!
LALALALALA
I won't lose! I will not ever lose!
Now you should understand what I mean
Anxiety is a reaction to earnesty!
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
It's greedy, but everything is all a treasure
I shall continue protecting you
We don't even know what's lying
Beyond this road before us
Is it connected to the future?!
Ah, my anxiety still won't fade, but
As much as I've believed in someday...
For sure, it'll be alright.
Tomorrow will be sunny!
So, smile! Hallelujah! Yup! Yup!
It's perfect, isn't it?
Yup! Yup! Yup!
It's alright now.
Tomorrow will be sunny!
Come dance with me
That timeless punch line never grows old,
I like it, like it
It's so colorful everyday
Light is shining through
And our dreams begin coming true...
LALALALALA
I won't lie to you about my rising emotions!
LALALALALA
I want to overlap with you!
For sure, it'll be alright.
Tomorrow will be sunny!
So, smile! Hallelujah! Yup! Yup!
Exciting, isn't it?
Yup! Yup! Yup!
Yeah, it'll be alright.
Tomorrow will be sunny
So, let's dance
I want to bloom, I have high hopes,
Let me, let me
I'm yearning for them Everyday
LALALALALA
It's the best! It's the best, very best!
LALALALALA
I won't lose! I will not ever lose!
