No two things are the same
In shape, pattern or color.
Everyone has it, including you and me,
The pleasure feather is always in our hearts.
Whether it's last night, tomorrow morning
Or right now, our feelings change.
The only thing that remains unchanged is ourselves.
So let's love ourselves.
Before you look down, worrying alone, talk to me.
It's okay, I'll pull you by the hand
And invite you to a sunny place.
Soar, the pleasure feather, into the spacious sky.
Surrender to the free wind.
There is no right answer, take your own step into the future.
If this world is a drama,
Because you are its main character,
It's enough to have a little more self-confidence.
Let's straighten our backs and walk on!
Each of us has our own pace.
There is no need to rush, looking only forward.
Let's take three steps forward and two steps back.
Let's go somewhere along the way.
Not everything is defined as true or false.
Dip the tip of your pen into ink
And draw everything as it is.
Brightly the pleasure feather comes out of the frame
Where the lines intersect with each other.
Let's share ideas together
To make this day special.
If this world is a drama,
Because its scenario is also flexible,
It's enough just to pack your ideals tightly.
Let's reach out our hands beyond the image!
We met after overcoming
Countless choices.
Now we can laugh together under the same sky.
It seems natural, but it's not.
This is what fate is.
One pleasure feather is in my heart,
My own feather, unlike anyone else's.
Easily and softly we fly to where joy awaits us.
If this world is a drama,
Because you are its main character,
It's enough to have a little more self-confidence.
Let's straighten our backs and walk on!
