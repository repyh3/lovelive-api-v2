Selene... celadon
Selene... moon
It's okay to fall to the ground,
As long as you rise and live with elegance and resilience
It is a mystery; it is like an angel and yet it's also a warrior
The tides of life reveal that visible glory is fake
After tasting bitterness
If you are tormented by sins and punishment, it's a sign to sharpen yourself
Even if you resist the mission you swore to,
The path you believe in will surely be beautiful
Now then, because life waxes and wanes
We live in the present world and scatter fiercely
I ask the waning sixteenth moon, as I'm overcome with an aching sadness
Does fighting for the sake of happiness count as true justice?
The story of the moon's messenger burns
With passion and intensity
I already know that someday this will come to an end
Even if I erase my memories without a trace
And start over, nothing will change
Maybe not in this life, but in the next,
We would still be drawn to each other
I'm sure I'll end up seeking something beyond eternity
It's strange to think that this is love
But I love you
I plead for time to stop as it is now,
But can only scoff at what a cheap wish that is
Now then, because life waxes and wanes
We live in the present world and scatter fiercely
I won't let you say that our meeting was a mistake
I thought I was protecting you, but really, you were the one
Who was protecting me
I just want to be by your side, that's all...
