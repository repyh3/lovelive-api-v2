Today my fortune is the best
I received a revelation from the stars:
"You may meet your soulmate"
What should I do?
If I dash forward with toast in my mouth,
Maybe we'll bump into each other
What, no, but...
I like rice better, oh my god!
When your heart contracts, is it a sweet feeling?
Or on the contrary is it bitter?
I don't know, I don't know,
Where is it?
When I open the front door,
The curtains rise
This film without a script
Makes me nervous but excited
It's so strange, but the usual way to the station
And waiting for a green traffic light,
Even that makes me feel like something is about to happen
I'm looking for clues everywhere
I dreamed about it from an early age
This time I'll be the heroine
Even if the weather forecast is rainy, this is also my lucky chance
I'll take the bus
Holding onto the hanging rails, maybe our hands will touch
Hey, what should I do?
For tens of seconds, I look at the train schedule
How long until the next one arrives?
Wait, oh my… That’s just awful
I'm so late for the first lesson
When your heart contracts, is it a strong feeling?
Or is it just problematic?
Explain to me, explain to me
Where is it?
This film called time
Can't rewind anyway
Even if there are no cameras around,
I'm a little fussy and nervous
But, when the rain stops and the sky clears up
The world after the umbrella closes
Shines so brightly
As if someone had used magic on me
We all once dreamed about it
Today I'll also be a heroine
"Okay, cut!!!"
"Kozue-senpai!"
"Will I really be able to meet my soulmate?"
"Who knows?"
"Actually, maybe you've already met them?"
"Ah? Where, where???"
"Look, right in front of you"
"Kozue-senpai......!!"
"Wait!! I didn't mean it like that~."
Because I can’t see how my heart contracts,
Because I can't touch this feeling,
I don't know, I don't know
What the end of it all will be
Tell me, tell me
Where do I go?
When I open the front door,
The curtains rise
This film without a script
Makes me nervous but excited
It's so strange, but the usual way to the station
And waiting for a green traffic light,
Even that makes me feel like something is about to happen
I'm looking for clues everywhere
I dive into the screen
I dreamed about from an early age
I'll take a deep breath and run
This time I'll be the heroine
