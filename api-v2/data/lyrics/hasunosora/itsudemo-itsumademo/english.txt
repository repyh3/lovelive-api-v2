As if I were dancing again, I recall those precious days
I set my dream on the soft, dancing breeze and this is where it all begins
It's making my heart tremble with hope and anxiety
The sights I once knew are already fading into the future
I finally realized what's truly irreplaceable to me
It is the smile that has always been blooming by my side
(A blooming smile-this is our bloomin' story)
I let the moments we carved into our hearts
Drift into the blurred sky
Because I'll never, ever forget them
So let's make a promise, right here in this place
(Thank you and goodbye)
Even as we wait to blossom in the future
Our dream has always been right here, with us
Even if we're far apart from each other
The dazzling light in my heart will never fade way
You may be setting out for a boundless world
But we're still connected by the same sky
I hope you'll keep blooming even more beautifully
I'll race forward with everything I've got, until the day we meet again
If you ever lose your way, just remember
To wipe your tears and hold onto the promise we made
The one thing that never changes, no matter what
(In my heart, it's still a bloomin' story)
In the moment that I had met you
Something I longed for was born
I'll keep it connected forever and ever
Let's keep painting it with new colors
(Brand new my color)
Until the moment our wish comes true
I wonder, how strong can we become?
I won't stand still or hesitate anymore
Because I want to shine with everything I have
Through every meeting and farewell
A miracle is born once more
Now I wish I had held those days even tighter
You were always there smiling, just like I remember
Each time the seasons turn, those feelings only grow
All the things I wanted to say are starting to spill out
When I try to put it into words, it doesn't come out right all the time but...
Thank you for everything
Even as we wait to blossom in the future
Our dream has always been right here, with us
Even if we're far apart from each other
The dazzling light in my heart will never fade way
You may be setting out for a boundless world
But we're still connected by the same sky
I hope you'll keep blooming even more beautifully
I'll race forward with everything I've got, this isn't a goodbye, until the day we meet again
(Forever) with a smile (we'll always be right here)
Until the day we meet again, see you again (this dream will keep going on)
Keep blooming forever Yeah
