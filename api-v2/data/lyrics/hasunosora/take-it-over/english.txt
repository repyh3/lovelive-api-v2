While I stood alone at the observation post,
My eyes captured the surrounding scenery
The real reason to fight
I, myself, don't understand
In the shadows of the horizon
The light has definitely appeared,
Even if the seething waves of my emotions
Still can't subside
If you only want to evolve,
You'll simply learn your limits and become weak
The more I reject the way things are,
The more the whirlpool swallows me
Take it over
Now that I've faced
My weaknesses that I hated
This place will become the eye of the typhoon
Will you dive in it with me?
I'm rolling and rolling in a direction I'm confident in
Take half a step back, sorry, sorry
My emotions are rolling and rolling again today,
While I renew my destiny
Stay close to me, please...
The observation point changes
And there are more sceneries that I want to protect
I track down the reason to fight,
Even if it's selfish
Don't say it, I already know
That I constantly place
My "complacent" hopes on you
But I want you to stay close to me!
No matter what days await us,
I will protect you
Even in those difficult days, when my dishonesty,
Which I hated, is ready to show its face,
I'll definitely say that everything is fine,
So that I can become even stronger
As long as I'm hoping for a happy end,
There's no time to be depressed
In this mortal world full of rustling flowers,
I'm looking for the consequences of my frothy dreams
Tonight I'm just drifting again,
Swaying, in the dark whirlpool
Please, don't be surprised, you have to see this
Take it over
The dawn of an uncertain future
Is more dazzling than I expected
This doesn't suit me, in my opinion
The waves have become quieter than they were before
Because now that I've faced
My weaknesses that I hated
I'll turn this place into the eye of a typhoon,
Will you dive in it with me?
Even if I'm afraid of this invisible road,
I will live in the present
