That hourglass that had the words "I'm ok" locked in,
I believed it was the correct answer
But why, why then do I have such feelings?
My seething emotions,
A dilemma resurrects in them, oh, no no...
Break my shell, knock, knock
The ones who opened the door were you guys
In fact, I've been waiting for this for so long
Let's finally be reborn
An unknown drama fills this world
Even if I'm selfish, I can't stop! I want to get passionate!
Are you ready to the new world?
I will show it to you
We're like rose madder
Just burning up my heart
This stage paints us in dark colors
I will let everything go without any pity
We've only gone through the prologue
We're like rose madder
I just believe in myself
As long as I'm with you, I can meet the best
Right, in all respects passionate rose madder...
"I don't care" — screams a siren that needs to be silenced
Everyone has painful feelings
After all it seems impossible to lie to yourself
Because it's now, I know
That I can't meet the next stage alone
My heart begins to beat loudly, knock, knock
You guys made me notice this
What lies ahead is not mastered yet
It's time for our spirits to wake up
With a serious expression, look at us now baby
Even if it causes laughter, I won't let it end
Are you ready to the new hope?
After all I will present it to you
We're like rose madder
Just burning up my heart
Where does your heart lead you, hey, do you feel
An undeniable impulse, running through your entire body?
We're like rose madder
I just believe in myself
As long as I'm with you, I can meet the best
Right, in all respects passionate rose madder...
"Deepness"
We're like rose madder
Believe in the future
This is the music that brings us together
I will never let you go again, holding you tight
I will be close to you
We're like rose madder
Just burning up my heart
This stage paints us in dark colors
I will let everything go without any pity
We've only gone through the prologue
We're like rose madder
Just believe in myself
As long as I'm with you, I can meet the best
Let's begin
My reason to live
Illuminate in all respects passionate rose madder...
