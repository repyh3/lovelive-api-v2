This is DJ MiraPa! In the city you live in,
Microphone check, one-two, OK, we will reach you.
Everybody, assemble!!
Every Sunday fill your schedule with the word "date".
Take time to listen to my voice.
Until the day we meet again, like in a long distance relationship,
Don't change the channel, don't you dare cheat on me.
Even if I lose control, go off course and forget the ending,
Smile, forgive me, my sincere feelings are stronger than ever!
This is telepathy☆communication, with its invisible threads
Telepathy constantly binds us firmly, penetrating into the very heart.
One step forward and we have a great relationship.
Today again our philosophy is born out of great love.
And for you, listening in the farthest corner of the galaxy,
Well, let's go, today we're also energetically on air.
Everybody, assemble!!
A wide smile spread across the face,
Amazing dazzling thunder from a clear sky,
A little dizziness adds its spice.
Please, beware of intoxication.
I'm waiting for your letters, your love letter has arrived to me.
Praise me as much as possible, this alone makes me the strongest!
We're courageous and majestic, as expected.
So, look, wow, this is amazing, just aerobatics.
We will pave the way to the tops with words of love.
The engine is at full throttle, excellent, the best gasoline in the tank.
And for you, waiting for the salmon set lunch,
We continue further, let's sing together.
What is today's theme? Just a thumbnail is not enough.
Want to listen? Want to know? Can't wait? As expected.
I feel an airy feeling of sleepiness.
Ah, I want to eat a big bowl of ramen.
Sometimes it blurs a little and cools down.
But! But! It's charming too.
Telepathy☆communication with its invisible threads
We're courageous and majestic, as expected.
So I guess we can do anything!
This is telepathy☆communication, with its invisible threads
Telepathy constantly binds us firmly, penetrating into the very heart.
One step forward and we have a great relationship.
Today again our philosophy is born out of great love.
And you, lost at the Ginza ticket office,
Stop and listen to us carefully now.
And for you, listening in the farthest corner of the galaxy,
Well, let's go, today we're also energetically on air.
Everybody, assemble!!
