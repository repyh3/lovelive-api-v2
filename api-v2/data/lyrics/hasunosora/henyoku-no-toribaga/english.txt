I am but a moth, spreading out my wings
I'm like a savior bound upon the cross
Torn from salvation, its fragile wings destroyed
And all of that was only the avant-title
Yeah, that's right, romance is actually born from a sense of loss
Humans... they live so carefree, I can't help but envy them
Is it the black or the white that each of them carries?
Happiness, misfortune
Together with both sides
The reasons for life
Pure devotion to Bucabeira
Love and prayer for Santa Maria
A moth, burdened by the sin of desire
With its wings torn and a cross carved upon its back
Pure devotion to Bucabeira
Love and prayer for Santa Maria
If loving one another is considered a sin
Then overturn their judgement
Because my heart isn't pure or beautiful,
I can be kind and accepting
Don't you dare say something like you're not beautiful!
Because I won't accept it!
"She looks like an angel"
"She looks like the devil"
All I've done is play a part, hiding myself in mimicry
You don't see through it
You can't see through it
You won't - though I know you see right through me
The definition of what is right
Changes with the times
Who decides our sins, our punishments, our judgement?
They're more arrogant than God himself
Don't be afraid to be imperfect
Don't be afraid to be imperfect
With these moth eyes, I've gotten a glimpse of the true world
In this dance of life, in this dance of absurdity
Pure devotion to Bucabeira
Love and prayer for Santa Maria
If loving one another is considered a sin
Then overturn their judgement
Because my heart isn't pure or beautiful,
I can be kind and accepting
Don't you dare say something like you're not beautiful!
Because I won't accept it!
It's okay even if you're not beautiful
Now, dance plume moth!
