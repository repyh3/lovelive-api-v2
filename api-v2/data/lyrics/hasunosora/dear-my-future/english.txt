I left this letter I'd written to you, who's living
In a tomorrow I have yet to see, in the back of a drawer...
I hope that one day I can leap across time
And gently push your back
It's difficult, huh? The reality is it's not always rewarded
How about you? I hope you're not struggling with your ideal image of yourself
Do you have a smile on your face right now?
Don't lie to me
In times when you want to cry, don't simply grumble "I'm alright"
Because you are in tears, right?
The first symptoms of perfectionism suddenly appear
There are times when I strongly dislike everything
I guess my character is still just the same as ever
I'm not able to always treat myself so kindly
Facing forward as you walk ahead isn't the only way for one to be strong
Unless you look behind you, you won't be able to see your footprints
Where are you right now?
Whenever you're lost, I want you to remember:
Becoming grown up doesn't mean you have to throw away anything
It's even the same thing with dreams
Carefully, I'm searching through the many replies,
So as not to fail to notice anything,
Today, too, I travel along the long path unfurling before me
Do you have a smile on your face right now?
Don't lie to me
In times when you want to cry, don't simply grumble "I'm alright"
Because you are in tears, right?
Is there happiness in your life right now?
Can you say that you love it all?
From now on, I won't give up on the girl I call me
Because I'm you
