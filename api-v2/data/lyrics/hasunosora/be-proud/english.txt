The knife I hold my hand is a fate entrusted to me
After losing something so precious... what could possibly remain?
This time, I thought I could live beautifully, as a true human being
But I just... I just...
Couldn't forgive myself
Why did, why did, why did, why did I believe this?
So then, why did, why did, why did, why did it have to end in sorrow?
Even if everything I know were to vanish like bubbles
If I could go on living in someone else's heart
Even knowing how sharp the pain in my chest would be
I'll still choose to dance on these two feet of mine
Because what cuts through fate isn't a knife, but it's pride
Longing and admiration rush over me with the dusk
Even if the rippling waves steal this voice away, again
Still I sing, even, even, even, even though it may be in vain
Here on this earth I struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle, like I'm swimming just to survive
Love cannot be born if there are no days with regret
Even if it's considered to be self-righteous
It feels like when you're picking up tiny seashells along the shore
It fills me up with such soft and tender feelings that are precious to me
So this is the me I used to dream of...
Even if everything I know were to vanish like bubbles
If I could go on living in someone else's heart
Even knowing how sharp the pain in my chest would be
I'll still choose to dance on these two feet of mine
Because what cuts through fate isn't a knife, but it's pride
