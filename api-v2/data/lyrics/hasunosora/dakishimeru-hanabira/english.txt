Close your eyes and listen
To the singing voice that echoed that day
I still can't catch up to
Your smile, but...
When I close my eyes and look
Even the tears shed that day
Now I can understand their meaning and sincerity
They are so precious to me...
I was scared, unable to believe
But you gave me courage in this world
Our promise (our promise) will always (continue)
To live on
The countless miracles we have collected here
Are because I met them here with you
"I love you" — it wouldn't be enough to say it
I'll embrace the petals and walk on
The promise of "it'll be okay"
Connected our hearts
Hey, what could I give you in return?
Can I give back anything?
Being apart is scary
But surely the scenery will expand
One day (one day) tell me (softly)
What color it is
The countless traces we've left here
Are because I raised them here with you
"I love you" — I still want to say it
I'll embrace the petals and sing
I won't forget your gentle smile
Thank you, thank you
I won't forget your passionate gaze
Thank you, thank you
I won't forget, from here on out
Thank you
The countless miracles we have collected here
Are because I met them here with you
"I love you" — I wonder if you understand
I'll embrace the petals and walk on
