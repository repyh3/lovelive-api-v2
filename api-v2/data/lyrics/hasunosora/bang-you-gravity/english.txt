Let's get out from under the futon and have some fun.
The fun is just beginning, let's go.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!
In a swirling parallel world
We continue to run in circles.
If you jump, you'll feel weightless.
You brought this whole universe.
This is not a nameless star,
But a large-faced moon.
I can't leave you.
It's BANG YOU gravity.
I want to make it come true,
The graffiti that I drew with you.
Dreams are endless,
They create infinity in a single heart.
Even Newton would have been shocked, surprised, and straight stupefied.
Let's escape from this blue planet and have some fun.
Barbecue in the sun...
"Hm? Ah! Wait! It's on fire!!!!"
Let's catch the Martian and play "thief-police".
If we join forces, no one can escape us.
Even a water flea thinks sometimes.
Drifting on a sea of worries,
Hearing splashing in the distance.
That's you laughing on a giant swimming ring.
I won't leave you alone.
It’s BANG YOU gravity.
I want to make it important,
Spaghetti that I'll share with you.
It's irreplaceable,
Asking for tea with milk after meals.
Little things like this are my treasures.
I can't leave you.
It’s BANG YOU gravity.
I want to make it come true,
The graffiti that I drew with you.
Dreams are endless,
They create infinity in a single heart.
Even Newton would have been shocked, surprised, and straight stupefied.
(I love you)
Please stay by my side from now on.
(I'll always love you)
Let's keep running like this.
(I love you)
I'll be by your side from now on.
(I love everything about you)
We're the best in the universe, aren't we?
We're equal, the strongest, and the best!!
