My present and yours are tied together now
This is that story
Just like the water which wets my paintbrush becomes clouded inside its cup
Alone at the end of the day, my mind is filled with worries
My too-clumsy plans for the future,
And this feeling that has no name
Painted the picture of my incomplete freedom
It's strange isn't it? It's only now that I understand
I'm not alone,
So I want to try beliving in my true heart
Bearing the colors of me and you
Flowers suddenly bloomed atop our canvas
The world changes, from the moment we reached out our hands
We could create any scene at all
The cherry blossom pink dancing on the spring breeze,
The blue of the days when the summer sky calls out
The red that burns in autumn sunsets,
And the silver winter
Each day is filled with blanks,
And the single seconds that simply pass us by
They become treasures, if I'm with you
When if I search in textbooks
I won't find it, I can't find it;
So I'll take off and go forward my way
Bearing the vow we made together
The stars flew across the sky above our campus
Even if a tomorrow that freezes us with fear waits for us at the edge of the dawn
If you're here with me, everything will be okay
So we won't forget
So we can remember right away
This breath, and this heartbeat
We'll leave them all here
Bearing the colors of me and you
Flowers suddenly bloomed atop our canvas
The world changes, from the moment we reached out our hands
We could create any scene at all
I'm certain...
