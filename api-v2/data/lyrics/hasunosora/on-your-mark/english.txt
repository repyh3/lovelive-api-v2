We know that our hearts are like traffic lights, working randomly
But it's pretty clear to us that they won't lie, so let's go
Though I know that nothing is absolute,
But I'll rush forward, wanting to try to challenge
Instead of determination, it's better to have a first-class thrill
On your mark, ready, set, go!
A ray of light that fell from a dark gray sky
I'm out of breath, but I keep chasing it
Drawing the best image
Open it
It will be a dazzling era
I won't hesitate anymore
Though I'm still a little afraid,
But I want to be sure of my impulses
I found something «the only one» for me!
My dreams are fluttering, dreams are fluttering
Even if I clumsily start them,
My dreams are fluttering, dreams are fluttering
I wanna believe in myself
What can we see in this muddy world?
The road opens, when you're determined
Let's say goodbye to the snow that has powdered the ground
I'll imprint my footprints in it
Dear future me, don't worry
Leave the rest to me
Add a first-class thrill to your determination
On your mark, ready, set, go!
Though I'm filled with anxiety
That not only good things happen in life
But I don't want to give in to empty fantasies!
I wanna live here and now
Convey
Your dazzling feelings
Far away, so that they go around
The globe that carries them.
I want to fulfill my impulses
I'll deliver something «the only one» for me!
My dreams are fluttering, dreams are fluttering
In this uncertain world
My dreams are fluttering, dreams are fluttering
I wanna believe in myself
My smoldering emotions began to shine
And now they are well read on my face
Please, be who you are
Rushing through this mortal world, bloom in all its glory
It will be a dazzling era
I won't hesitate anymore
Though I'm still a little afraid,
But I want to be sure of my impulses
I found something «the only» for me!
My dreams are fluttering, dreams are fluttering
Even if I clumsily start them,
My dreams are fluttering, dreams are fluttering
I wanna believe in myself
Wanna believe... yeah
