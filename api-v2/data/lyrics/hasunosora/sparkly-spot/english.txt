If, freezing your regrets,
You took a deep breath,
You would notice this sky
Clouded with your excuses
The track laid by our steps
Is a history, consisting entirely of choices
But we cannot compare our answers
With the answers of everyone else
May we move by touch on our journey
But if your heart desires it
No doubt, cry this out sincerely
My measured true voice creates
A distortion that embellishes my resolve
Not letting my stainless heartbeat stop,
I want to see more of the world that I believed in with you
The light that burns undeniably in our place
Overtakes our worries again and again
If we vow to each other to change in the future
Its flares will intersect
If, by freezing your words,
You would remove all noise,
You would hear a whimper
In the silence
The future that the second hand hastens to bring closer
Is a utopia that cannot be rewound
Although each of us
Has the right to hesitate
Wanting this, I muttered: "time to change"
My measured cautious voice creates
Modulations that shake my resolve
Even if a headwind blows, resisting it,
Depending on my feelings, I won't hold back.
Ever since we knew without a doubt where our place was,
Our pain reshapes us again and again
But, even as we change in the future, our strong hopes
Will continue to cling to flares of light
Don't worry, it's your life, better be natural
Check this beat in my heart, it's not too inflamed
"It's up to you to decide"
I don't need balance, my true voice creates
An overload that holds my resolve together
Not letting my stainless heartbeat stop,
I want to see more of the world that I believed in with you
The light that burns undeniably in our place
Overtakes our worries again and again
If we vow to each other to change in the future
Its flares will intersect
Melting the closed doors
Colors are crossed with pride
