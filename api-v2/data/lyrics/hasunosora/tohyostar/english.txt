When I think of slipping in loafers,
I think of inviting all kinds of trouble
The solution is to vote for your☆star!
Rewatching my archive, cringing and sweating
It's as if the teacher is chiming in (NO NO! Yes, yes!)
So, the heart is the broadcast episode? I see!
It all depends on how you think about it! (That's right! Genius!)
I want to say YEAH!
But maybe, she is SHY.
I want to be close to that side of you
And there's more!
Something that'll have you laughing without meaning to
We're about to whip up a whirlwind
As wild as blooming Chinese milkvetch!
When I think of an overwhelming show,
I think of a sauna heat wave master
The heart of it is: "It's wonderful!" (SPA!)
When I think of smooth sailing,
I think of the bottom of a cup
The heart of it is: "A good start!" (Star!)
I want to unzip humor's zipper
And find the source of anxiety
Everybody, let's sandwich it with this patty-oh,
Make the burger with extra care-oh
The carefully selected ingredient is... love-oh!
When I think of a follow, I think of crab rice
The heart of it is: "Don't mind, don't mind!" (don-rice! don-rice!)
I can't say sorry,
It's just too precious.
Why can't I overcome my own pride?
In other words,
You're really good at holding back!
Well then, let's make good use of it!
Perseverance is well-utilized!
How do you turn a near-death moment into a clever little riddle?
You solve it as "I'll handle it somehow."
That's what makes a star!
At the start, we're all a little timid,
Our hearts are just ordinary models
But, just like an action star,
When you can't overcome your anxiety just go ahaha
When I think of an overwhelming show,
I think of a dish with a lemon slice
The heart of it is: Hey! Star☆ (so sour!)
When I think of printing 10 sheets,
I think of baking bread
The heart of it is they're toasted! (Star!)
The sign that the world will change
Is to give rather than receive (Present for you)
I want to unzip humor's zipper
And find the source of anxiety
