What colors do you like?
What colors do you use to paint your dreams?
There is no one thing that's the same,
They are all beautiful in their own way.
There are times, when you don't know
Which answer is correct.
Let's slowly hold our hands
And go look for it.
If we could color the sky of our hearts,
If we could draw a rainbow arch there and show it each other,
It would become a sparkling, colorful world.
Everything that is reflected in our eyes would become dear to us
It cannot be expressed in black and white,
This exciting feeling undoubtedly
Has a nameless color, and that's okay.
Choose your own color and go to the future.
If we could be close even in distant places,
If we could share the stabbing pain in our hearts,
Look, a bright wind would blow,
To wipe away our falling tears.
If we could color the sky of our hearts,
If we could draw a rainbow arch there and show it to each other,
It would become a sparkling, colorful world.
Everything that is reflected in our eyes, this landscape
Would become even dearer to us.
