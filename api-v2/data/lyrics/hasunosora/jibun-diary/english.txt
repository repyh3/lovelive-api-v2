Dear tears, bitter tears...
I heard that efforts are rewarded sooner or later
But it looks like mine only ended by dreams
Look, "absolute" is just a lie
During a joyless shower time
My sighs mingled with steam
Since the next complaint came to my mind,
I want you to put them in bubbles today and let them go with the flow
Even the days, where there are no episodes, about which something concrete could be said,
I want to cherish it, because I'm their main character
I can't overdo it all the time
My story continues at my pace
Looking back, I'm somewhere behind again
Ah ah ah... Hah...
I heard that the pain heals sooner or later
But I guess I just got used to mine over time
Look, "expectations" is a useless thing
Popular vanilla ice cream
Stole the warmth from my lips
My unexpectedly falling tears
Reflected the room light so bright
Late at night, when I can't sleep, even if I don't want to sink into sentimentality,
I offer wishes to the stars behind the curtain
I shouldn't compare myself to others
I'm searching at my own pace for only one dream,
But I can draw more than one dream
Even if I look at the calendar on my desk,
The present doesn't change. So I'll lie down for a little... good night.
Even the days, where there are no episodes, about which something concrete could be said,
I want to cherish it, because I'm their main character
I can't overdo it all the time
My story continues at my pace
Looking back, I'm somewhere behind again
Ah ah ah... Hah...
