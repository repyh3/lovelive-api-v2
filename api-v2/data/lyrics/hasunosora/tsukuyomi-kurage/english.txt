Seeing a butterfly fluttering above the water, I wish I had
Pretty, beautiful fins, can't I wish for something I don't have?
I dream of colorful scales forming a dress of petals,
Is it strange to dream of such a thing, though it may not suit me?
Why is my body always transparent?
Should I try to swim, if I'm not good at it?
I can't become the sea moon, just by wishing for it.
Let's just say goodbye to the days gone by.
It's okay, I know the taste of tears better than anyone.
Look, every time I rush around bubbles appear like pearls.
I'm a moon jellyfish looking at the swaying sky above.
My voice doesn't reach you, but I still sing my song,
Is it stupid to imitate a mermaid princess?
Right, it's easier to just keep drowning.
Should I resist it?
Because ugliness is also a part of me.
Today again I feel like I'm drowning in a glitter that I can't catch up to,
But my suffering is proof of my determination not to give up.
I'm sure no matter what shape or form you were, you could come here.
You know, someday I'd like to gently light up someone's world.
Having survived the cold, the darkness and even loneliness,
If only I could give you one answer...
Let's just say goodbye to the days gone by.
It's okay, I know the taste of tears better than anyone.
Look, every time I rush around bubbles appear like pearls.
I'm a moon jellyfish looking at the swaying sky above.
Let my song reach you!
