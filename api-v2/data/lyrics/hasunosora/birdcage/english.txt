Please, forgive me for being such a coward
I feel so warm in my birdcage
Even if I try to stop the clock hands with my fingers,
The scenery outside the cage will still keep moving. I don't like this.
It seems like becoming an adult
Means getting more scars
The precious moments that are fading away
Also become memories
I wonder if I, who lives in tomorrow,
Will be able to change properly?
Let's walk down the path illuminated by our dream together
I don't have an umbrella, so I'm waiting for the sky to clear
I'm sorry, I can't keep our promise
It hurts, but I don't need to check the answers to this feeling,
Which we couldn't learn from textbooks alone
It seems like in order to believe
You need to have courage
Those moments when you cried, while looking ahead
Also becomes the future
I hope that you, who lives in tomorrow,
Will be happy
Let's make a new dream our home
Just as you taught me these emotions,
Which seem to spill out and disappear,
If I wrap my arms around them,
I'll teach them to someone else too...
It seems like becoming an adult
Means getting more scars
The precious moments that are fading away
Also become memories
I wonder if I, who lives in tomorrow,
Will be able to change properly?
Let's walk down the path illuminated by our dream together
Let's go to the sky, connected by the miracle of our meeting
