All the stars bear prayers upon their backs.
From the moment I took off under the comet's blessing
I realized I had been mistaken in the way I tried to reduce it
The meteor shower I once saw
Just how many dreams,
And the struggles of those dreams, did it know?
Beside the colorless sky's gray shower,
There is only a single thread
Burst already
Break apart for me, shattering even harder than a diamond
Even if an incombustible life is reused,
It will only be burned by the same karma again
Even days where it's like there's molten ash
In the air still tremble with hope
I wanted to believe that it had been thrown away
I'd even convinced myself it had
Because it was so much easier that way
The bright voice of twinkling brilliance,
So clear, is heard high in the sky, high in the heavens
Once again, I'm searching for something that's not a dream
But something very similar to a dream
Am I only searching because I want to feel fulfilled?
Hope and dreams are only for show
In my empty heart, one fragile thread remains
Truthfully, I want to cling to you
I want to cry and scream, I've been in pain all along
I'm so tired of even being tired
I curl up in the ash, letting it fall on me
Burst already
Consume me in a flame hotter than the fiercest Wolf-Rayet
Surely it can burn. If it won't catch when I strike the spark,
I'll burn it anyway
All the stars bear prayers upon their backs
Crossing the atmosphere at last - the boundary line
The rays of light streaming swiftly through the gaps in the clouds
All the dust chases after such a star
Even though you are so honest and unwavering
So innocent, so dear, so beautiful
Under the sparkling night sky
I find myself trembling with hope once again
