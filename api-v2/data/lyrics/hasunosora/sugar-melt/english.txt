That’s a bird, that’s a giraffe, I wonder if that cloud is a whale
I can’t help having so much fun until our rendezvous time
A gentle breeze is blowing through the fragrance of a golden osmanthus
Bringing a little spring sunshine, you wave your hand
When we meet eye to eye, the world slows down
Can it be that you can use magic? (Hey, can you use it?)
Gently and sweetly, it unravels
You are, you are a cloud of cotton candy
Even my hesitation like granulated sugar
Is made light of
Unraveling in the autumn sky,
With you, with you, I’ll always be
Before it disappears in my mouth forever,
I have to let you know
“It’s a frivolous season” as the proverb goes, but
The days continue to be sunny, and in my heart
I don’t mind even if there’s a passing shower, but rather,
We bump shoulders beneath the parasol we share
I’m dyed up to my ears in the colors of autumn foliage
You used magic on purpose just now, didn’t you? (Hey, you used it, didn’t you?)
Lightly my body’s floating in the air
You are, you are a wondrous person
Even the pain of my slight shoe sore,
I feel like I’ll completely forget
I will… forever be…
When we meet eye to eye, the world slows down
And even the hands of the clock stop breathing
I’ll only say this once because I’m embarrassed
I can use magic, too (Hey, I can use it, too)
Gently, gently, and sweetly, it unravels
You are, you are a cloud of cotton candy
Even my hesitation like granulated sugar
Is made light of
Unraveling in the autumn sky,
With you, with you, I’ll always be
Before it disappears in my mouth forever,
I have to let you know
My true feelings
I love you.
