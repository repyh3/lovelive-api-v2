One-two-go, yeah!
Let's go, let's go, I want to give it my all (yay!)
Come on, come on, I want to enjoy it all (yay!)
Take a look, 'kay
In my left chest heart I exclaimed: "Wow!"
In my head fireworks exploded
It's not a festival, but it's still a celebration of sorts
The fanfare is on all year round, it never ends!
What is love? I looked up at the sky above, and fell
I'll tell you everything in order (please!)
It's a live broadcast, (wonderful!) it's a live (awesome!)
Games, cosmetics, fishing, and you, you and you
I guess I'm quirky by nature~ Oh well, it can't be helped!
Today I'll just promote what I like again.
It's only natural, isn't it?
I'm the strongest cheerleader squad, I'll take the lead and scream
I like it, like it, like it, like it. I wonder if it reaches you?
Let's get through this together, even the ups and downs. Our goal is first prize!
It's fun, fun, fun, fun,
Because it's a trophy (it's win~)
Pretending not to care is proof that I actually do
I don't need the word "self-control" in my vocabulary anymore
It's illogical, but it's a sixth sense, seventh, eighth.
You can call me greedy (great!)
Friends, (yeah, yeah!) school (uh, sure!)
Club activities, sweets, naps, and you, you and you
This is happiness~
This ladder goes on forever, I wanna be a challenger.
I'm changing, changing, changing. I'll know it when you're here
I'm the strongest cheerleader squad, I'll take the lead and scream
I like it, like it, like it, like it. I wonder if it reaches you?
Let's get through this together, even the ups and downs. Our goal is first prize!
It's fun, fun, fun, fun,
Because it's a trophy
I... I'm not going to end like this
I... can't end it like this
Even now...
The fanfare screams at me: "Do your best"
The fanfare screams at me: "Don't give up"
The fanfare, I hear it
The fanfare shows me dream
