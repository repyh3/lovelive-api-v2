Every time I turned a new page, courage settled in my heart
The same with the excitement that I felt at that time and this story, more exciting than a fairy tale
What future does this lead to?
This is the beginning of the second chapter, it just can't end like this!!
From "my dream" we will come to "our dream"
Let's connect them and promise that from now on we'll have better smiles!!
This story doesn't need a "sorry",
Because I always want to send only a "thank you" to your heart
On sleepless nights I identified myself with the main characters lined up on my bookshelves
I will continue to believe
That this unknown world exists in reality!!
Even if it's just a "miracle" now, someday it will become a "trajectory"
I won't give up, watch how its meaning changes!!
This story belongs to no one else
Your name is definitely there, written in transparent ink, just take a closer look
The size, strength and even the reason may be different,
But it's normal, isn't it? Let's call it a dream.
I would like it to come true,
Because I think everyone feels the same
Let's bloom together!!
From "my dream" we will come to "our dream"
You're the only one, but don't forget that from now on you're not alone!!
This story doesn't need any regrets,
Because I want to leave only a "thank you" on the pages you write
