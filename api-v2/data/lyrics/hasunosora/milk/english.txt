I want to keep chasing interesting things
The voice of my heart still sings today
You know, I'm so full of things I love,
That I could cry
The feeling of frustration and my bitter coffee,
Dilute them with gentle milk
Hug me with the sweetest smile, saying: "welcome back",
Because this way I can do my best again
Thank you for your purest warmth.
Thank you that I still have my place today.
Because, wherever I am, I have you,
I can proudly say that I'm the strongest
Thank you for your purest love.
Thank you for always pushing me forward.
I want to fulfill my big dream with you.
And until then, until then,
Please forgive me for being slightly selfish
I'm honest, but I lack openness
I wonder if this could cause misunderstandings?
You can see that I'm only pretending to be strong,
Still I'm bad at lying
The feeling of trembling and my numb fingers,
Melt them with your gentle warmth,
Because I show you my smile as always,
Exaggeratedly saying loudly: "I'm home"
I'm a little embarrassed, but thank you.
Let me say this properly: "Thank you for everything"
Don't ask me what happened
Until now, until now
I just kept it a secret, that's all
Thank you for your purest warmth.
Thank you that I still have my place today.
Because, wherever I am, I have you,
I can proudly say that I'm the strongest
Thank you for your purest love.
Thank you for always pushing me forward.
I want to fulfill my big dream with you.
And until then, until then,
Please forgive me for being slightly selfish
