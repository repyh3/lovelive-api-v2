Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
This, this and that — we're all busy with something
Wait, why does this really matter?
I held my breath, drank in one gulp and twisted my face
Doing this every day is too unhealthy
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Your heart is deficient in vitamins
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
You need to charge your smile
Come on, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
This energetic, pumping rhythm
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Everyone enjoys it☆
Come on, come here
Why not have a little adventure from time to time?
Let's enjoy this moment together now
I won't do this, I won't do that — we constantly postpone something
Why, why can't we keep the right sugar level?
I dream about it, but that's no reason to cut calories,
Because it's impossible, I need a reward
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Hurry up and shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Taste the new you
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Ask for supplements as many times as you want
Come on, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
It's just awesome and enjoyable
Hey, shake it up!! Sh-sh-sh-shake!!
Being in a good mood is the best☆
Come on, come here
Why not have a little adventure from time to time?
Let's enjoy this moment together now, with you as well
Right, we can't hold back anymore
Why don't we make today a cheat day?
Let's enjoy it together: this moment, this moment, it's time to do it.
