Rocked by the sleep train's gentle lull,
I drift into what might be a long, winding journey
Let me sleep tonight, still hiding that one small fear
Beneath the calm of my resting heart
Half-asleep,
I sway with the crowd, the train is bursting at the seams
Like sushi pressed in a box
A young couple, curled like a fish in quiet waters,
Sleep with their bodies gently entwined
Oh, my beloved, where have you gone?
In Mumbai? Chennai? Or Dehli?
Baby, the jam-jam-jamboree
Goes on forever
Namaste, I want to see you
Maharaja, the seasons I spent with you are all so precious to me
I'm a masala storm-storm, a wild-hearted girl, but still, forgive me kuripaya-ya
Maharaja, I'm still tightly holding the letter that you left behind
I'll even take the moon and sun along with me on this path
Because goodbyes just don't taste any good
Through every train station and town I passed,
This is a road with no way back
I gazed at a back that could have been yours,
And my heart filled with a sigh
My beloved, what are you up to now?
In Agra? Varanasi? Or maybe Pune?
Baby, the jam-jam-jamboree
Will keep going from here on too
Namaste, I want to see you
Maharaja, even the night sky blushed after we danced through it together
Come on, hold-hold hold me tighter
I want you to do it properly. If this is a dream, don't ever wake me up
Oh, my beloved, where have you gone?
In Mumbai? Chennai? Or Dehli?
Baby, the jam-jam-jamboree
Goes on forever
Namaste, I want to see you
Maharaja, the seasons I spent with you are all so precious to me
I'm a masala storm-storm, a wild-hearted girl, but still, forgive me kuripaya-ya
Maharaja, you leaned in close as you whispered in my ear "my priya",,,
And even though I hate it-hate it-hate it, I always end up drowning in the loneliness
Maharaja, I'm still silently reading the letter that you left behind
I'll even take the moon and sun along with me on this path
Because goodbyes just don't taste any good
