I want to find
Something that is uniquely mine, that's all.
I couldn't ask for anything more
The more I look for it, the more I lose sight of it.
The premonition that I could change has disappeared,
Even though it should be here somewhere.
My exhausted regrets are melting in the waves
(Don't look back)
In fact I knew
That it was okay to not be special.
Even if I'm afraid to show
That I'm embarrassed and regretful again,
If the future is beyond this current highest point,
Should I leave my ideals here?
So that my dream, which has begun to take shape,
Will bear fruit,
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more
I want to believe that it will come true.
I think this will be proof of it.
I want to find
Something that is uniquely mine, that's all.
But will I be able to find it?
The more I look for it, the harder it gets.
Hopes and expectations
Become heavy shackles for me.
I tried not to regret the wrong choices
(For my heart)
I feel like the light will shine on me,
Because I'm so determined.
Even if it gets hard to worry about
All the unfinished business,
If I can ever surpass the highest point,
I feel like I can love myself all down to my weaknesses.
If I don't give up on any given day,
I hope it pays off...
Because I can't see the right answer,
The thought of giving up arises in my soul.
But I managed to get up again and again
Not for someone else, not for someone else,
But for myself and no one else.
So I will run forever.
Even if I'm afraid to show
That I'm embarrassed and regretful again,
If the future is beyond this current highest point,
Should I leave my ideals here?
So that my dream, which has begun to take shape,
Will bear fruit,
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more
I want to believe that it will come true.
I think this will be proof of it.
