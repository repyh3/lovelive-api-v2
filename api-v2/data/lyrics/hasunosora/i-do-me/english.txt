There's something I want to ask the flowers blooming wildly upon the water's surface
How can you still hold your head high and stand so tall
While covered in mud and exposed to a raging storm?
Tripping over a tiny, insignificant pebble that no one would even notice, I'm left crouching down
Because my unadorned heart still felt far too weak, I set up a false front,
Just trying to make it through
I do me! Goodbye!
Yeah, yeah! Even version updates are advancing day by day, you know
Even if it's only 1mm a day, that's okay
Root yourself in your true feelings and question your weaknesses and strengths
Dreams and self-identity are a skill up
Tears shining with the night dew
Hesitation, misunderstandings, and even my doubts...
Little specks of stars sway in three-beat harmony,
Though their glow is far from the dreams I reach for
Because I finally understood that we're burning with the same fire inside our hearts
I do me! It's fine, I have to make it reality
Everyone has their own place to bloom. I am my own self!
Pressing my feet firmly into the earth, I tightly confirm it once more
Have confidence in that one step
I do me! We do us!
Even if I'm flustered and stumbling in impatience and frustration
What matters most is having the courage to face it
A series of bright smiles and images of the future overlap
Yeah, yeah! Even version updates are advancing day by day, you know
Even if it's only 1mm a day, that's okay
Root yourself in your true feelings and question your weaknesses and strengths
Dreams and self-identity are a skill up
I do me! I never give up!
