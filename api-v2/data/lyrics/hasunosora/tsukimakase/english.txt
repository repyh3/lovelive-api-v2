This gloomy bedroom is painted
With our sweet topics of conversation
Because the sun hasn't risen yet
The emotional theories collide
With our partially loaded love brains
Because, even when he no longer sees fairy lands
Man believes in cryptic words (foggy)
Such as "by knowing love, you can become stronger"
What is perfect love (no matter how much they tell me, this is a difficult question)
Suddenly I'm excited about it (I'm embarrassed, when I think about it)
Stop replaying misconceptions
It's kind of a futile job
I wish I had a place, where I could be myself, without embellishing myself...
The plan to achieve happiness
Probably no one knows
Hiding a scenario full of expectations
In my chest, I want to cry
My old daydreams,
It seems, were pure fiction
I'm sick of this low-fidelity mood
My heart is in a state of roulette again
Even if the annoying love shows
Laugh at our lie-filled youth
Saying it's just a childish lie
The day the love spell is cast on me (really)
I wonder if I'll be a laughing stock too?
Wanting to change the scenery (stretching my back a little)
Even if I went up the stairs (nothing would change as much, as I thought)
Stop being in a safe position already...
Of course, I can't say it out loud
I wish I had a place where I could be myself, without getting hurt again...
Make a plan to return to sadness
Probably beyond my strength
Saying goodbye to this gloomy face
It seems impossible for me to come to opportunism
I guess I've been worrying too much
About these clumsy rules
I'm immersed in an hi-fi vibe
But my roulette never stops
It's not that I'm not interested
In things like glass slippers
Or diamond tiaras,
But I'm a bit of a realist
My girlish heart,
Swinging in perfect balance (don't show me only dreams)
Maybe it's fickle
Like the roulette chances
Perhaps it's possible to replay the misconceptions
I will continue to live my way
Even if it's hard to be myself, without embellishing myself
The plan to achieve happiness
Probably no one knows
Hiding a scenario full of expectations
In my chest, I want to cry
My old daydreams,
It seems, were pure fiction
I'm sick of this low-fidelity mood
My heart is in a state of roulette again
Anyway it will happen again today
We can talk about the same topic
My thoughts that are slowly growing dull
Let them spin a little more in my head
In this darkened bedroom
We carry on meaningless conversations
Even after the moon has gone,
My heart will be in a state of roulette
