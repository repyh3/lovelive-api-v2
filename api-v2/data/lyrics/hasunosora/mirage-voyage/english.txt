My tears that stealthily sink into the sea,
Where will they get to in the end?
Why do they overlap with the words
I've been hiding deep in my heart all along?
Bathed in a whimsically dancing wind,
I remembered my past dreams
I'm so tired of worrying about the days, when they are unattainable,
That I just ran away
The city lights that lit up
Color the loneliness of twilight
Even though I already declined to answer,
Don't make me hopeful with your dim light
What do you want to do?
Future out of my focus,
Even if I know it's a mirage,
Is it useless to want to believe in it
Again and again, again and again?
There's nothing to be done,
Though I want a little courage
So I can be proud of who I am
Ah, I'm glad to see again (nostalgic)
Dreams at an unattainable (distance)
I will overcome both my regrets and my scars
Even if something formed
Seems right to me, causing me anxiety,
I want to convince my heart that it's okay
And walk on
A drop hidden by my fingers
Shines brighter than fickle landscapes
Although we're no longer destined to cause miracles,
The days we've accumulated seem to make sense
What should I do?
In a world full of hints
Even if there is no right answer,
Is it useless to try to do everything possible
Again and again, again and again?
I'm not interested
If you smile, pretending that everything is alright,
You will probably not worry about anything
Ah, I'm sad to see (new)
Dreams in your little stoop (shadows)
I forget even what I so passionately desired
I still don't see the end and edge of
My endless dialogue with myself, which is so painful
But it's normal.
Future out of my focus,
Even if I know it's a mirage,
Is it useless to want to believe in it
Again and again, again and again?
There's nothing to be done,
Though I want a little courage
So I can be proud of who I am
Ah, I'm glad to see again (nostalgic)
Dreams at an unattainable (distance)
I will overcome both my regrets and my scars
