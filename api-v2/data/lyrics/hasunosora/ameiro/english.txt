I'm walking along the faded road home
The cold autumn wind strokes my cheeks
Even if I don't say anything,
You can't understand everything, right?
I place the time spent with you
On my slightly cold palms
My countless hopes,
They are all so warm
Tomorrow and the days to come,
I think in the end I won't be able to say
That my present exists
Because I met you
I ran, carrying the feelings that I want to convey to you,
Along the road, where the dancing leaves are falling
I'm sure we can talk soon,
But won't I put you in an awkward position?
The tree-lined avenue you're walking along,
If I too can blend into the landscape,
It will probably become not beautiful,
But I want to be by your side today
If we could share
Our tears, joys and worries,
I would feel happy.
So I'll call you by name
In the end I hid my unvarnished desires
The road we walk side by side is our future
Although I think it would be great
If only this time could continue like this forever
It's my fault that these feelings don't reach you
Even if I understand this, I can't take the first step
In the end I tighly clutched my hand
"See you tomorrow" was all I could do
I ran, carrying the feelings that I want to convey to you,
Along the road, where the dancing leaves are falling
Now I want to give you more,
Although words will not be enough
I'm walking along the faded road home,
The cold autumn wind strokes my cheeks
If only you could carry within yourself those feelings
That I was unable to convey to you...
