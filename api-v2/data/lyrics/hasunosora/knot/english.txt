Let's make a new promise
The oath that binds us
Lights up the light, let it illuminate the unknown
Why are you worrying?
I wish I had more freedom
But I told myself so many times:
Bye bye to your weak self
Let's go, let's go, from that very day,
When I broke the chains, freeing my heart,
I feel that I was able to become so stronger,
That I'm able to change my future myself
It must have started with a little coincidence,
But now I don't want to let go of your hand
Even if I relive the moments of the present hundreds, thousands of times,
I think the day still won't come, when I'll know
If it's right or wrong (What's my life?)
But the days I choose like this are my answer
One by one I make sure of
The knots filled with my intentions
No, no, don't look right through my heart
From that very day, when I broke the chains,
I was scared, I felt that I would probably give up
I'm drowning in the memories
"Stop" or "This is impossible", —
Don't tell me this categorically, I'm tired, I'm tired
"It's not right for you", "It doesn't suit you", —
I'm tired of hearing this, I won't stop, I won't give up anymore
If I relive the moments of the present hundreds, thousands of times,
I think I can be here, just without wondering
If it's right or wrong (Keep my faith)
The continuation of this great dream that I can't voice,
I will keep it locked in my heart
For you
Your hand taught me
That the future I painted is not just a fantasy
Even if I relive the moments of the present hundreds, thousands of times,
I think the day still won't come, when I'll know
If it's right or wrong (What's my life?)
But the days I choose like this are my answer
One by one I make sure of
The knots filled with my intentions
