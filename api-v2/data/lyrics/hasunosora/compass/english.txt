Hey... I ned to say this,
This "admiration" of mine
If it's about the real me, the part of me you can't see,
Then it's not going to disappear, will it?
The roads I must wander through, having to feel my way around
Every path I follow seems to lead back to where you are
I can make wishes but having expectations is a little frightening
When the sky realized it wasn't alone
The rain came to an end
Maybe everything is simply as it was meant to be
Guided by the compass my feelings created,
I'll move beyond my dreams
I want to see a changing world
Maybe it was better as a dream
But, through it all, you stayed right next to me
Just for this moment, I'll break free from all the formulas
And find the answer for myself
Ah... the traffic light
Turns blue at the crossing
What colors paint the dreams of those passing by?
It's a place where countless stories intertwine
I'm getting closer to becoming my true self
Even if I can't always choose the right path to take
The future I built for myself will always find its way ahead
I realized no one could take my place,
And finally, I could face the truth
A gentle chime rang out, leaving its mark in the silence
Never forget the flames that has crossed paths
Beyond the struggle
The glimmering future I mapped out
Written and erased on the blackboard
I was so happy, so full of joy, that I felt like I could cry
Turning words into action, we'll surpass the dreams we once "admired"
When the sky realized it wasn't alone
The rain came to an end
Maybe everything is simply as it was meant to be
Guided by the compass my feelings created,
I'll move beyond my dreams
I want to see a changing world
Maybe it was better as a dream
But, through it all, you stayed right next to me
Just for this moment, I'll break free from all the formulas
And find the answer for myself
