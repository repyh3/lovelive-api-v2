This is a theater of non-fiction
There's no script
Just the spotlight
In this movie we call life
I want to connect with all of "you"
With every heart, from all over this big wide world
Even if my past is shameful
Even if it's colorless
Let's try to project
Those tears of emotion onto the screen
And watch them turn into colors
The theater of my life
May still be a flawed mask
Even if it's embarrassing,
I want to try living with everything I've got
Life isn't only happiness,
Nor just something that shines
I want to love the path I walk, not just where it leads
This goodbye isn't a tragedy
The sequel is already in the works
Can't lean on anyone, can't ask for help, I'm alone...
Afraid of being disliked, I learn to read the room
If it's true that everyone's the same beneath it all
Then, for what comes next, all you need to do is have enough strength
When our dreams fall apart,
Anyone can end up alone
But, if we can see this through, I'll let myself hope for the sequel
The theater of your life
May not be some masterpiece
But there are emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure that belong only to you
In moments of unhappiness,
Inside those plain, forgettable scenes
There are surely many things that can be found
A goodbye isn't a tragedy
It's the moment you step out of the theater
Because it's filled with dazzling light
