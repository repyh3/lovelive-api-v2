Lalala Lalala Lalalala..
The raindrops are ringing,
Continuously hitting the ground.
I wrap myself tightly in my cocoon,
To avoid getting wet.
Perhaps it might be a waste to not know,
But my heart immediately gave me the answer.
I want to see with you the sceneries
That await on the other side of the unknown.
It's time to flap our wings, the sky is calling us.
Guided by the wings
That carry all sorts of dreams,
We have finally found the sky, although it's so capricious.
Let's release our hidden resolve.
Hello, brand new world
We can fly away to the other side
We can fly away there, believe me
The light reflected from water drops,
After they pass,  I could look into them for the first time.
Is it a miracle or a coincidence?
It depends on us what we call it.
When I close my eyelids, I don't even need to think,
My heart itself tells me everything.
Precisely because it's happening now, my flowing tears
Are turning into something incredibly beautiful.
It's time to flap our wings, the sky is calling us.
I won't hide my excitement.
We have no other wings.
Come on, let's go to a brand new world.
The mirror surface of water erases the boundary, separating the worlds.
As if rewriting ourselves from scratch,
I feel like we can fly anywhere.
Everything will be fine (as long as I'm with you) I'm sure!
It's time to flap our wings, the sky is calling us.
Guided by the wings
That carry all sorts of dreams,
We have finally found the sky, although it's so capricious.
We no longer hesitate, so let's fly up higher and higher.
Hello, brand new world
