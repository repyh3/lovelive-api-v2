I wonder what I should write about?
Whenever I pick up the inked brush
Past or present, it's always the same
Look, look...
A faded love letter
A poem whose author is unknown
To the unwavering voice that has stopped time
Listen, listen...
I'm sure, I'm sure
There are some things that will not be kept by time
More, more
Throw everything you have into it
Come on and dance with the snow, sing with the moon
Stand tall and be your beautiful self
Be so striking that you can't be forgotten
Now, go with the wind, bloom with the flowers
So that the world you live in will always
Shine brightly
After wiping away the dark stains
All that's left are clumsy words
Yet when I dream, the tears and smiles resurface
Look, look...
I know, I know
That keeping things going isn't easy, but...
More, more
With all the determination and resolve I can muster
I'll stay here
What did you wish for when you looked up at the sky?
Was there something you longed for so much it kept you awake?
Our hearts will remain unchanged
Together, forever, we'll be maidens
Come on and dance with the snow, sing with the moon
Stand tall and be your beautiful self
Be so striking that you can't be forgotten
Now, go with the wind, bloom with the flowers
So that the world you live in can always
Embrace the past that's already slipped by
Even in the distant, unseen future
May our "present moment" continue to
Shine brightly
