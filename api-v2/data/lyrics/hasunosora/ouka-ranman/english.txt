Thousands of fragments of time
Are tremblingly fluttering in the air
Oh wish, now's the time for you to become a flower
Together with this season
My distant dream is a foamy mirage
If you say that it's only an illusion,
Why hasn’t it vanished yet?
Let's search for (let's search for) our own unique sound
Let's make (let's make) even our voiceless voices blossom
Without lying to the feelings that will never wilt,
Let's live like an iroha song
As a breeze of petals is blowing,
A brand new me gets her beginning
What lies ahead of me as I run
Is not tears, but such days that are
Tinted with light colors that I want to believe in
Even though I wish the cherry blossoms could remain beautiful,
They become soiled as they're tread upon
And their petals look so lonely
You'll probably laugh at me and tell me
"Forget about such things so we can move on"
Even if they become just a burden,
This sadness and regret
I'll bring along with me
As a breeze of petals is blowing,
Even if something ends in secret,
The memories will surely never fade away,
Nor will that tree-lined avenue where the light grows
Where are you, out there?
Playing a blindfolded game of hide-and-seek?
How much more must I slumber?
How many more times will it go around?
I've been counting on my fingers
As a breeze of petals is blowing,
A brand new me gets her beginning
What lies ahead of me as I run
Is not tears, but such days that are
Tinted with light colors that I want to believe in
My dream is beneath the sky in full blossom
