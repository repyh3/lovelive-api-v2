I wonder how far we'll be able to go
I started running, just lost deep in a dream
Our strides were (uneven)
But I overcame (that memory)
It's all a miracle
Farther and even farther,
You push me forth at my back,
'Til the day arrives when I blossom
Beyond our dreams that have now come true
I wonder what kind of future awaits us
"No matter what happens, my feelings will never change"
Those words you spoke have blended into the sunset
I would've given up long ago
Had the dream I chase only been my own
But your stride I matched, (the feelings)
I shared with you, (and even our tears),
I love them all
Higher and even higher,
I reached out my hand towards you
We'll head to the promised place
Bathed in the light of the dreams we've dreamt,
What will we think and feel? And what will we learn, I wonder?
"I wish the present could continue forever!"
Your voice trembled as you pretended to be so strong...
Beyond our dreams that have now come true
I wonder what kind of us awaits us!
"No matter what happens, my feelings will never change"
I vowed as I gazed up at tomorrow's sky
