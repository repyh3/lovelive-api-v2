Let me say, let me say I'm tougher than you think
Go my way, go my way, I don't need a hand to guide me
Wait, wait, wait, wait now
In fiction, this would be impossible
Life is evolution, so come on
Say hello, brand new era
Even without dressing up, we're turning heads
T-shirts and jeans are what we're pulling up in to this party
Now, strip off both your ideals and your pretenses
Let's move it, just move it
Let's dance tonight
I'll defy the conventional path (I want to make them understand)
I'll rewrite destiny (now, let's create art)
To a greater or lesser extent, yeah, I'm not the cooperative type
Instead of the majority, I'll pick the minority
This is reality
We are the nεw black (It's beautiful)
We are the nεw black (It's beautiful)
It's too much to look at, right? Oh-oh-eh-oh
It's too much to handle, right? Oh-oh-eh-oh
I won't act fake or try to please anyone
I guess that doesn't make me the cute type
I won't let anyone define me - I'm the Nεw Black
This isn't ego talking. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm just not holding back
This is just pride. Yeah, yeah, yeah
As you can see, mine's just higher
I have no intention of getting drunk on tragedy
A happy ending is up to me
Hmm, Cheugy is a good bye
I'm not interested. Hah!
Crying just because you're sad? That's nonsense
Saying "I'm frustrated" and then crying is the better choice
Let's cast a magic spell
"I am beautiful, wonderful, and radiant"
I'll lead the way (from the front lines)
A princess in every sense of the word (come on, you too!)
To a greater or lesser extent, yeah, it's completely outrageous
Praise or criticism, bring it on 'cause I'm gonna be free
This is reality
We are the nεw black (It's beautiful)
We are the nεw black (It's beautiful)
It's too much to look at, right? Oh-oh-eh-oh
It's too much to handle, right? Oh-oh-eh-oh
I won't act fake or try to please anyone
I guess that doesn't make me the cute type
I won't let anyone define me - I'm the Nεw Black
