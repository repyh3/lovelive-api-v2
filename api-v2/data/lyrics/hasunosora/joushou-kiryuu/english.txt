It begins here
The wind blows into the depths of my heart
Colorful balloons swell high and free
Sorry for my greedy and carefree spree
I clasped the end of a dream so softly that it floated out of sight
Of course, the world's my destination
I want to recharge my heart's foundation
If I hit a wall, I'll tear it down,
Open a hole and turn it around
Higher, higher, I'm aiming for the sky
It's changing, changing - the scenery
"Are you leaving me behind?"
There's no way, that's impossible
It begins here
Move forward, move forward, and ride the wind
Have you, have you been made aware
That we're always looking at the same sky
Hey, don't forget
We'll meet again
As we ride, as we ride the turning wind
And then, and then when that time arrives
Beyond what we thought is a totally crazy
And insanely fun future
Just before getting scolded
It's chaotic, and everyone around is in an uproar
Everything I've selfishly played with, I'll carry it with me wherever I go
Out in the frontlines, not in the safe zone;
Despite my worries, I stand strong
It all depends on where you're headed
Even headwinds can be tailwinds
No one is, no one is bound or confined,
That is, that is just who I am
Don't overthink it, just go with the flow and feel the moment
I'm not afraid
Even in far, far away places
This moment, this moment will continue
See now, our hearts can overcome any distance
Hey, keep smiling
I believe in us
We're the best, we're the best, aren't we?
In short, in short, we're the strongest we can be
It's a bit bright, but even if your eyes
Can't yet see that future
If I'm with you, it feels like I could fly through the sky,
With dreams that have grown so big
The hand that I hold gives me warmth
Yes, I'm not alone
It's beautiful
The red, blue, orange, green,
Pink, white, purple, yellow
And light blue balloons are floating
It begins here
Move forward, move forward, and ride the wind
Have you, have you been made aware
That we're always looking at the same sky
Hey, don't forget
We'll meet again
As we ride, as we ride the turning wind
And then, and then when that time arrives
Beyond what we thought is a totally crazy
And insanely fun future
Let's be more ambitious than ever before
Let's go!
