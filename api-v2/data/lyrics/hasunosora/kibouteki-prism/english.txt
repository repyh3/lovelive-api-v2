This small screen makes a lot of noise
Because the strangers keep arguing in it
Getting measured only by their titles and positions
I don't want to become like that
Our actions change the landscape
So that all roads fork?
I am now (this place)
Where am I going? (Is it correct?)
I went on a journey to find certain evidence
The future seen through the prism,
Show me how many branching you have
Each time we make our choice, it's given an arbitrary score
Not allowing myself to be disturbed in vain
I wonder if I'll ever get used to this feeling
When the world seems to move on,
Leaving only you behind?
Though I don't need to match my answer
Crescendo... Crescendo... Ways of my life
Crescendo... Crescendo... Lights of my life
People gather in groups outside the school building
But each of them finds their own individuality
Trapped in rules and common sense
I feel freer in my school uniform
If we could see the end of all roads
Would our indecision in action disappear?
But I (in this place)
Look ahead (even if I worry)
At the road filled with faint light
Expectations that passed through the prism
Shouldn't necessarily always come true
If you make your choice again and again, you'll undoubtedly gain self-confidence in the end
It becomes your formless guide
One day there must come a day
When even my feelings, when I see
Someone happier than me, will change
Though it's hard to put into words
Falling into despondency from trifling misunderstandings
I complained that there was no place for me anywhere
But now I have stopped crying, hiding my weakness
The future seen through the prism
Show me how many branching you have
Each time we make our choice, it's given an arbitrary score
Not allowing myself to be disturbed in vain
I wonder if I'll ever get used to this feeling
When the world seems to move on,
Leaving only you behind?
Though I don't need to match my answer
Crescendo... Crescendo... Ways of my life
Crescendo... Crescendo... Lights of my life
