Let's let go of that faint, faint prayer
(Don't need to look back, tell yesterday bye-bye)
A new wish has begun to shine inside me
Even though I'm still small (Believe in this light for me)
Why? I'm stuck in a loop of asking myself the same questions
But now, I'm breaking free and heading into the future
The moment we connected, something sparked inside my heart
It was a feeling I'd never known
Spark in my heart
I've already realized
That passion is what drives me forward
Life is so bright
Even in this world that I once despised
Just look, this unstoppable feeling won't quit today either
And I just know it's not wrong
Discharge all of your emotions and turn
Shock to change
Let's take a step forward, even if it's a little scary
(Don't need to regret. Light up the future)
The time I spend hesitating feels like it might go to waste
So I want to change the tomorrow I've chosen
Stage for my dream
Yes, I can't help but wish for it
If I'm serious then I'll give it everything I've got
Way to be the light
"What do I really want?", that answer...
I still don't have it to this day
But I know that I don't want to run away
I'll rise beyond destiny and
Take a new chance
Ah - my brain feels like it's about to short-circuit, it hurts
Is this what freedom is?
I caught the signs
And couldn't help but smile,
It's okay because I don't regret a single thing
Spark in my heart
I've already realized
That passion is what drives me forward
Life is so bright
Even in this world that I once despised
Just look, this unstoppable feeling won't quit today either
And I just know it's not wrong
Discharge all of your emotions and turn
Shock to change with my pride
