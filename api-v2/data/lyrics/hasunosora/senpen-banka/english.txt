In the kaleidoscope, I could see a thousand trapped flowers
Superimposed atop one another, those were lovely days
In the after-school classroom, I envisioned the future
And even decided on a title; "The New Me"
Rain and sun, neither one alone will form a rainbow
They shine because we've laughed and cried together, you know?
You see, another flower has blossomed
A little dream has blossomed
In a world like a bouquet of flowers
If there's that coloration in my heart,
If I have you next to me,
I feel like I can give my best still
I drew a line and stopped before I reached it
I don't think I read that right anymore
Spring, summer, autumn, winter, they keep changing, that's the same
Even if you're troubled, because you've overcome, there's a different view, isn't there?
"I'm sure." "I'm sure." It's a repetition of that
I can't let it wither, that's all
Face upwards, face upwards, transmit it
You see, another flower has blossomed
A little dream has blossomed
In a world like a bouquet of flowers
If there’s that coloration in my heart,
If I have you next to me,
I feel like I can give my best again
