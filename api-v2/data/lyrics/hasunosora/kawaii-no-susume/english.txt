I fell in love at first sight
With this ivory dress
Does it really not suit me...
I've been admiring them for a week now
Let's put some makeup
On your timid feelings
When we lift your eyelashes,
Applying magic to them with the tip of a brush,
Let's put this on you
Bathed in the shining bright sun,
Make me fly and then your smile will change too
I'm also a real girl
I want to be called cute
One shining bright fashionable thing is enough for me
For life is fine and I could become the best of all
Although I tried to jump over my head more than usual,
But maybe a day like this isn't so bad either
Everyone's nails are so colorful,
That my eyes just run wide
I think mine is being watched too,
So I carefully hid my fingertips
I agree it's a misunderstanding,
But still it worries me
So I rushed to the cosmetics shop
Seller, please, make them dry in a minute!!
Bathed in the shining bright sun,
Make me fly and then everything will change
I'm still a girl
I want to be filled with happiness
My shining bright mood means
That life is fine and I achieved this
Although I tried to jump over my head more than usual,
But it may turn out to be wonderful in its own way
Just a little courage
Was the only thing I lacked
Everything will be alright, everything will be alright
In fact I knew it from the very beginning
Bathed in the shining bright sun,
Make me fly and then your smile will change too
I'm also a real girl
I want to be called cute
One shining bright fashionable thing is enough for me
For life is fine and I could become the best of all
Although I tried to jump over my head more than usual,
But maybe a day like this isn't so bad either
