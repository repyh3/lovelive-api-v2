Explosion! Detonation! Infinite power (KABOOM!)
I want to clash with others,
But it's still far from enough
When things go too well,
I get anxious and start looking for pitfalls, but
When there's nothing in them,
I get frustrated and start digging things back up myself
As for me! I'm serious!
It feels like you might grant me everything I could ever want (Eh!?)
It's not about winning or losing,
So why does it still feel like I've already lost?
If things stay this way (I can't even call it mutual love!)
Because I love you so much!!
With our feelings unleashed, let's keep fighting!
Letting small sparks scatter even more
Until we become like a huge firework
(If we don't do this, the future won't change! Let's go!)
From here on out!!
It's an emotional breakthrough, let's dive in!
Let's make this moment explode even more!
Because I have no intention of ending things by just maintaining the status quo
So this time, it's my turn
Explosion! Detonation! Infinite power (bring it on!)
Are you really speaking from your heart?
Are we really sharing the hard truths?
Something outrageous? That's great!
Crazy vibes? Also great!
I know I'm being spoiled way too much, though...
Maybe I want to be cool...
Because I'm not that super cute girl
As I thought, if things stay like this (Alright! I can see it now!)
It'll get so hot it burns!!
This is the real deal and it's burning!
You can feel it, you know it, and it stings
My burning feelings have ignited
(It keeps spreading and won't stop! Brace yourself!)
Face it head on!!
Proof of existence, just do it!
From now on, no more defending, I'll go on the offense
Because I don't want to waste the chance I managed to grab
I'll never let you regret it
Explosion! Detonation! Infinite power (how's that!?)
Hey, listen to me, you need to stand tall on your own two feet
I'll pour everything I have into my dreams, my love, and into you
Over and over and oner and over again (I won't ever give up!)
Because I love you so much!!
With our feelings unleashed, let's keep fighting!
Letting small sparks scatter even more
Until we become like a huge firework
(If we don't do this, the future won't change! Let's go!)
From here on out!!
It's an emotional breakthrough, let's dive in!
Let's make this moment explode even more!
Because I have no intention of ending things by just maintaining the status quo
So this time, it's my turn
Explosion! Detonation! Infinite power (bring it on!)
I want to clash with others,
But it's still far from enough
Show me your true power too (can you?)
