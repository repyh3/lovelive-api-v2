We're in a barren land where dust clouds dance
The failing traffic light flickered and then turned to red
O rootless dreamer,
Listen to this song
These vague and uncertain prayers
Are like distress signals
Gray feelings gnaw away,
And my heart cries out for this fleeting "present"
Turning it into a scream
Mayday; even though I never asked to be the perfect child,
In the end everyone
Yes, they've got me all wrong, and it's suffocating
Because all the labels have turned
The proof of my existence into worthless junk
Let's leave it all behind in today
Where will the path of the wandering lamb,
Who wished for change, lead them?
Will they still be able to laugh at the end?
O foolish dreamer,
Come and take this flame
Let's fight against this unfair world,
Causing a chain of failures and successes
A light blooms in the night sky,
Where sorrow-colored emotions are flickering
To that distant star I cry:
Answer me; this is Mayday
To my arrogant and unrestrained past self,
Please, if anything
Go ahead and laugh at this night. It's all so meaningless.
If every minute and second of living
To the fullest has turned into pain,
Then I'll stop now, that's enough
Mayday; even though I never asked to be the perfect child,
In the end everyone
Yes, they've got me all wrong, and it's suffocating
But because of you,
A single flash still pierces the darkness in here
I won't give an ending to this story
To keep the flame burning
