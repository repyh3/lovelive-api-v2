What's my name? Why am I here?
Keep going to be myself
The absolute hero from textbook (smiled at me)
For whom will he draw his sword? (The answer is hidden in the darkness)
Limited time of his life (turns the present into the past again)
Moment by moment he urged me on (how many nights have I seen?)
Ah, why I'm so disappointed (my heart)
Even after climbing the stairs (no way)
I'm still unreachably far from the sun (I pray)
I need wings (like a bird soaring in the crimson sky)
In any case all people
Equally dream all their lives
Just reach out your hand!
Even if the sky is still far away (it's okay)
I can't be measured by the ruler of talent
Because now I know
That I love myself for sure (boldly)
C'mon, show your sparkling smile.
Be your own sun!
What's my name? Why am I here?
Keep going to be myself
Even if the wind blows me away (and I fall)
Even if I get dirty (and get scratched)
It's just a scratch! (Just laugh at it)
I can still do it! (Look ahead!)
Spin the earth with your amazing passion
Ah, "I can't hold on until the end" or "I want to run away" (my tears)
Even if I'm so weak, and I'm ready to say it (no more)
I'm human, I'm me, so I won't give up on myself (I see)
Just take it easy (so as not to lie to my feelings)
Go, go, go, go, I want to go
Run, run, run, run, I run to change
No, no, no, no, I have to show
Fair and square, I'll be the light
Yeah, it's okay if I don't achieve my dream
I won't give up until the end (this is) my (proof)
Let's preserve more moments of the present
In any case all people
Equally dream all their lives
Just reach out your hand!
Even if the sky is still far away (it's okay)
I can't be measured by the ruler of talent
Because now I know
That I love myself for sure (boldly)
C'mon, show your sparkling smile.
Be your own sun!
What's my name? Why am I here?
Keep going to be myself
That's my way cause' I found it
Keep going to love myself
