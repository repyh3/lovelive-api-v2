Let's now chase those dazzling backs
That we had on the day we met
I heard the song that started it all
When you remembered a forgotten dream,
Your earnest eyes
Changed me something inside me
Because the best landscapes that I want to show you
Are undoubtedly waiting for us ahead, let's run towards them together.
Because everyday with you is filled with sparkles
(So special days)
The days when our smiles bloom and the days we cry, they all shine.
I can cherish every moment I spend here,
Because now I dream about the same thing as you, irreplaceable for me.
Let them continue to shine.
It's alright, every time I lifted my face
You were next to me and gave me the push I needed
I want to tell you now: "Thank you
For giving me the courage to continue to believe in who I am"
Having accepted this sparkling everyday, we will run forward.
(We can make it now)
We collided with each other, and then became one.
I want to spend my youth with you.
We can make it feel like we're invincible any day,
Because we believe in the fate that brought us to this place,
So that we can fulfill our dream.
Because on those days, when nothing really works out for me, I'm not alone,
I feel like I can do anything, if I'm with you all.
Now there are countless shining lights stretching before our eyes.
Now we will connect them to the next future.
Because everyday with you is filled with sparkles
(So special days)
The days when our smiles bloom and the days we cry, they all shine.
Because I can cherish every moment I spend here,
Surely, no matter how many years pass, they will continue to shine forever, never dimming.
