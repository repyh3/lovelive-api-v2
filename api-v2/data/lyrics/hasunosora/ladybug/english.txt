I don't want to hurt myself again
I'd probably be happier if I didn't have dreams
If I try to flap my wings
Hey, new emotions arise like bugs
Longing→impulses→action→going through the future
Should I give up on having talents? I don't know anymore
But I can't lie
Can I see? Can't you see?
The wishes we made
We tell ourselves they'll come true someday
Even the scars that won't disappear can't be erased
Look, embrace them, and move forward once more
Towards the place my heart decided on
That place filled with pure words
Can I feel? Can't you feel?
The dream you told me about
That day still shines
If it's all just a misunderstanding
If I feel like I'm about to give up
Even if nights of tears come
If I have those accumulated days
I'll be fine, I can say "I'm ready" again
Everyone carries struggles, worries, and anxieties
The constraints and parallel lines seem ridiculous now
But we should be proud, shouldn't we?
Can I see? Can't you see?
The missing pieces
They're always hidden close by
Even the endless passion that doesn't cool down
It turns into the light that leads to tomorrow
Looking for mistakes (Regret)
We keep repeating the same things
We should stop, the answer we chose
Is proof of our existence as "ourselves"
I'll fly high, spreading my wings
Can I see? Can't you see?
The wishes we made
We tell ourselves they'll come true someday
Even the scars that won't disappear can't be erased
Look, embrace them, and move forward once more
Towards the place my heart decided on
That place filled with pure words
Can I feel? Can't you feel?
The dream you told me about
That day still shines
I realized that we're dreaming the same dream
