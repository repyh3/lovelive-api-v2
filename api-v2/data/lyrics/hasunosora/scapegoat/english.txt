Don't pretend you understand
I'm sure you won't notice these emotions
Even if you read the corresponding textbook
They are so vague, that they bother even me
Looking at a world full of paired jewelry
Ah, I surrendered to the power of gravity
Our bond is made
Listen, from breathtaking gatherings
And scattered fleeting smiles
How many years will it last?
The king has changed
We're fighting for a place next to him
History has already gone down some ridiculous path
If you sit outside for a while,
You can see how beautiful the scenery is
But at the same time, you don't hear boring chatter
We categorize each other
Without any sense
Sorry, I was in the wrong place
Don't pretend you understand
It's not that I want to boast about my misfortune
I just don't know how to pretend to be strong
Even if I compare my life with others, I only lose myself
I don't want anyone to replace me
Ah, with these selfish prayers in my chest
I'll start walking again
This atmosphere is made
Listen, from the competition in herd behavior
And forcing unnatural smiles out of yourself
Will we have enough oxygen in it?
Every day we walk the tightrope
Avoiding irritants, we're looking for each other
I'm tired of all these obnoxious rules
We switch between
The classroom and the corridor separated by a line
We carefully accumulate
Stuffy peace and unreasonable freedom
This false communication,
There's no way I could forgive it
Don't pretend to be right
I won't be fooled
By a set of stereotyped phrases
I thought it would be wise to wait your turn
I don't want anyone to touch my pain
Ah, because no one has to worry about it
The sky that stretched out
Beyond the transparent window was so beautiful
That I suddenly stretched out my hand to it
Lonely pain in my heart
That hurts but seems about to disappear
Regrets and worries — with it all
I still can't say:
"I want to love you"
Don't pretend you understand
I'm sure you won't notice these emotions
Even if you read the corresponding textbook
They are so vague, that they bother even me
Looking at a world full of paired jewelry
Ah, I surrendered to the power of gravity
When a light breeze blows,
I feel like I've been recognized
And my field of vision clears up
