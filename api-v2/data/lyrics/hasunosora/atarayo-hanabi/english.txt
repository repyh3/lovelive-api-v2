Another ripe fruit has vanished into the dark sea
The cool breeze is gentle yet merciless
Even amongst a fleeting illusion, you were the one who lit the fire
Beyond the stillness is the sound of rippling waves
"Don't go..."
Ah, I understand, but only for a little longer, stay by my side like this
So that I can see the flower blooming deep within your eyes
Ah, I'm sorry, but yet another ripe fruit has fallen
Hey, is it okay if I touch your slightly chilled fingers?
As if something were missing from it
The crescent moon seems to resemble my wounds
If only I could pretend not to notice and smile
Ah, may the voice of my heart fall silent already, I'm about to end up in tears
Before the flower blooming deep within your eyes scatters away
Ah, it's that time, an endless cycle of nights that are too short
But, please let me believe that just tonight will be different
Unawareness is a sin as well, when you were the one who lit the fire
Even now, I'm burning up inside
"Look back at me..."
Ah, I understand, but only for a little longer, stay by my side like this
So that I can see the flower blooming deep within your eyes
Ah, I'm sorry, but yet another ripe fruit has fallen
Hey, I want to touch your slightly chilled fingers, just for today
