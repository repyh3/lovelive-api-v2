"All together!"
Let's aim for a world we've never seen before, a world we don't know yet
Let's go!
"Here we go!"
Anxiety comes rushing in!
I won't lose to it
To advance towards the future, let's keep facing it
You're not alone, because everyone is by your side
Let's overcome the obstacles with our own hands
"It's okay, let's go together."
A story we don't know yet
Is calling out somewhere even now
Let's start from here, all together, now!
"All together!"
Hey, jump up to the sky! Step up!
Don't be afraid
This will forever be a new story
A continuous stream of unexperienced excitement never stops
Step up towards the future!
Let's make our dreams come true
Summon your courage, take a step forward, and aim for the end of your dreams!
Let's go to a world we've never seen before, a world we don't know yet
Somehow things aren't going well...
There are days like that, right?
Let's change our mood! Let's draw our path
It's okay to hesitate, because everyone is by your side
Let's overcome this as many times as it takes with our own hands
"Look, I'm coming with you♡"
The hands we hold become bonds
And will become a bridge to the future
That's why I'm aiming for it with everyone!
"All together!"
Hey, jump up to the sky! Step up!
Don't be afraid
This will forever, forever be our story
A world that's always unknown, the excitement never stops
Step up towards the future!
Because our voices will always play
Summon your courage, take a step forward, and now it's your turn
Let's go to a world we've never seen before, a world we don't know yet
"Come on, we're still going!"
Let's unite our voices (LET'S GO!!)
Are our hearts ready? (OK!)
We'll open a new door
Let's shout out loud (shout out!)
To the distant future, the world beyond
Let's aim to keep moving forward, forever
Hey, jump up to the sky! Step up!
Don't be afraid
This will forever be a new story
A continuous stream of unexperienced excitement never stops
Step up towards the future!
