I found what is truly "important" to me!
It will fully bloom! I'm sure, the future will
Bloom the dream!
The seeds of dreams are buried deep in my heart.
Did you notice?
This is what I love!
The more complex something is, the more exciting it is
That's why (I wonder)
If I can wish for something this much?
The moments of the past are what make up the "present"
These sprouted feelings (shine)
They're dazzling!
Let's make it bloom! Come on, let's smile.
Hey, if your heart is fluttering, don't be shy,
You've gotta take that leap of faith
I want to bloom! If you believe that
Hey, then someday the flower will bloom
It's okay to cry, everything is fine!
It will fully bloom! I'm sure, the future will
Bloom the dream!
The feelings cause sympathy.
As if they called each other,
Even our hearts are getting closer!
No matter what, we'll all stay together
Get ready! (Jump!)
We'll get through this.
Yesterday moments up to today
Give me self-confidence,
Because I want to always be proud of myself.
(I can do my best)
The bud that I grew (the bud)
Has always been waiting for this moment.
It's fine to be worried
It's okay if you stumble
Let's enjoy the long way around
We're connected to each other, aren't we?
It's not a waste of time
Let's go (let's go)
Let's go, look,
Tomorrow is already here!
Let's make it bloom! Come on, let's smile.
Hey, if your heart is fluttering, don't be shy,
You've gotta take that leap of faith
I want to bloom! If you believe that
Hey, then someday the flower will bloom
It's okay to cry, everything is fine!
As long as we're all together, I'm sure tomorrow will
Bloom the smile!
It will fully bloom!
The future will Bloom the dream!
I found what is truly "important" to me!
So it will bloom the dream!
