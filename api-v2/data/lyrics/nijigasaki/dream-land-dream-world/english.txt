Hey when the door opens there
You'll find a fairy tale-like colorful world
If somewhere in this world
There were to exist a place like this wouldn't you like to check it out?
Even if the sadness grows darker (Don't worry)
If you come here, all of that will be made into smiles
To anyone
Welcome to A・ZU・NA Land, boys and girls
Let's dance along with splendid steps
Learning them by watching others is fine as long as you get your body moving
As if it's coming straight out of a dream
As long as you can imagine it, you can be anyone you want
Let's try to do the Shichihenge together!
This is a fantasy parallel world
Just like in the picture books you read as a child
Would you like a taste of this thrill and excitement
That no one's ever experienced before?
Even if you come by yourself it's all right (It's OK)
Your ticket will be that excitement living inside you
Come together
Let's find A・ZU・NA Land together
A dream you'd once long forgotten
If you close your eyes and wait, they'll come floating towards you
Let's have fun and forget about your frustrations and fatigue
We'll go back to being kids
And create a wonderful dream together
Even if the sadness grows darker (Don't worry)
If you come here all of that will be made into smiles
