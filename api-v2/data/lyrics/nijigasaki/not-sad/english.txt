We can believe
That we feel the same way
So let go of my hand and
Reach out to the future to achieve your dreams, Bye Bye
Fluttering flowers, floating tears
And then laughter blooms again
You'll always be
An important part of my life
So long So long; whenever I put on a brave front, and it collapsed
So long So long; you were the only one who saw
Hey, that's right, but even so
Because we've always been together
Running towards the light
At that time, destiny brought us together
Although my feelings played the future
We're connected, so I'll definitely see you again
Because you're important to me
"Goodbye" isn't the answer
It's the beginning of a new path
I'm here now because I met you
Every part of myself is filled with hope
For now, "goodbye" is a word of happiness
On the day when I finally see you again,
What kind of expression will I have? Surely it'll be more fun
That's why I'm not sad, not sad. When we see the sceneries again,
I'm not letting go of this dazzling moment
Sometimes someone is so dazzling
That I feel like I want to cry for being weak
I'm always worried about what's in store for me
I can hear my future playing on the wind, Bye bye
The same heartbeat, engraved time
You don't have to rewind to be happy
Always and anytime,
You'll see something if you look straight ahead
So good So good; everyday has been passing by like this
So good So good; you could say it's like a jewel
Hey, that's right, that's it
I realized that I created
Brilliant things that will last a lifetime
I found my destiny and held it tight
Thank you for so many memories
Flowers will bloom soon with tears that I wiped away
You'll always be important to me
Don't hesitate to say "goodbye"
It'll be okay, believe in the path you've taken
Everytime I think of you, I become stronger
That's why I'm not sad, not sad. I can go where my heart desires
I'm not sad, not sad. Let's smile at each other
To the precious future with my precious you
Goodbye, I'll never forget those dazzling moments
You're important to me
"Goodbye" isn't the answer
It's the beginning of a new path
I'm here now because I met you
Every part of myself is filled with hope
For now, "goodbye" is a word of happiness
On the day when I finally see you again,
What kind of expression will I have? Surely it'll be more fun
That's why I'm not sad, not sad. When we see the sceneries again,
I'm not letting go of this dazzling moment
