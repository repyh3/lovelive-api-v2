Although I'm a small, small bud now
The day will come when I'll bloom
Into a big flower
My days used to be boring and melancholic
But since then I've forgotten all about it
Now it's hectic but also fun
These new days will continue
Although I still can't find the answer to it
Let's keep growing together
From now and forever
Although I'm a small, small bud now
I will nurture this love that you gave me
I will soon stretch to the skies, full of vitality
The day will come when I'll bloom
Into a big flower
Your voice will be my water
Your radiant smile will be my sun
There are days that my face droops down
But as long as you're there with me
It will always rise up
Even though the flower had no name, even though it wasn't beautiful
Though its color was not the most vivid
A person found me on the roadside
So to make them just a little happier
I will bloom proudly
Let's go and sing!
Although I'm a small, small bud now
I will nurture this love that you gave me
I will soon stretch to the skies, full of vitality
The day will come when I'll bloom
Into a big flower
Someday I'll bloom
Into a big flower
