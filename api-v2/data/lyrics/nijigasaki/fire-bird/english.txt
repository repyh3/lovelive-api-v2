Burn this sight into your own eyes
Dance with me like the fire does
If we become more passionate and crazy
Nobody will extinguish our dreams
The sweat is dripping off our bare-naked bodies
Making ourselves twist to the will of our minds
Just by meeting eyes again we start to pick up speed
These dreams I'm having are hotter than before and won't stop
Somebody finally released the birds who were trapped in the cage
And with so much freedom, they flew even higher than they ever did before
The wings we are riding on are hot as ever
Dancing with them to the passion in our hearts
Is the soul that resides inside my chest
And from that an echoing rhythm is born
Burn this sight into your own eyes
Dance with me like the fire does
If we become more passionate and crazy
Nobody will extinguish our dreams
Dancing to an occasionally slow BPM
It's not like I hate it, but I don't feel free enough either
Let's throw away all other reasons
You accepted me as it is
Now's not the time to look back on the past
Let's fly higher and higher, and eventually farther into the future
Our resolution has finally been decided
This is something I'm sincere about
We have a fate which nobody can change
And to keep it going, I desire a fascinating rhythm
Burn this sight into your own eyes
Dance with me like the fire does
If we become more passionate and crazy
Nobody will extinguish our dreams
No matter how much time may go by
We'll never turn into ashes
The passion you feel when you close your eyes
Deliver it to me...!
The wings we are riding on are hot as ever
Dancing with them to the passion in our hearts
Is the soul that resides inside my chest
And from that an echoing rhythm is born
Burn this sight into your own eyes
Dance with me like the fire does
If we become more passionate and crazy
Nobody will extinguish our dreams
