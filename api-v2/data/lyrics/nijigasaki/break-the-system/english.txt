The memory is clear and it's like reality
So impatient and nostalgic
There is no such thing as a course of naturality
But still, you're always a dazzling light
Ah, even if I'm in a dream
Ah, I'm breaking it because there are no rules
A system that goes crazy
Decreasing entropy
Let's open up the future
We must go to infinity and beyond
And unleash it now
The given wish, to the top floor
Even if it's a bad footstep, even if it's incomplete
Set out a vector
And draw a vivid world
An irregular miracle is one coincidence
Attracted to one another like overlapping magnets
The fate we are led to by this distorted theory
We've a paradox to break with our hands
And we won't let anyone get in the way
Ah, onward to the weightless sky
Ah, until you cross the border, jump over it
It's a runaway on the verge of collapsing
Unimaginable emotions
And confrontations unknown
If it's irreversible, we must change it
Until we find out what it is
Even though a faint hope seems to disappear
I believed in that heart
And the brilliance of that light
So let's be sure to connect to tomorrow
From the seeds of solitude
Strong and ephemeral flowers sprout
Blooming crazily but beautifully
As long as there's love in the future to protect
And that's why
We must go to infinity and beyond
And unleash it now
The given wish, to the top floor
Even if it's a bad footstep, even if it's incomplete
Set out a vector
And draw a vivid world
I believed in that heart
And the brilliance of that light
So let's be sure to connect to tomorrow
