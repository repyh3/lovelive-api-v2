I fell in love with you at first sight
You just have to love me
Trust me, your heart
Of course I understand what's in your heart
I'm sure I want to have you
Love is always simple
Love makes everyone submissive
I have already lost my head from its scorching rhythm
I grabbed the bow and arrows
Of passionately burning love
'Cause I won't let you go again
I will have
All of you
Woah
C'mon C'mon C'mon Hands Up
C'mon C’mon C'mon Hands Up
I'm on my own free will "HUNTING FOR LOVE!!"
Woah
C'mon C'mon C'mon Hands Up
C'mon C’mon C'mon Hands Up
'Cause I'll show you a fleeting dream, yeah
I won't let you go
'Cause I will catch you
To get you, I'm "HUNTING FOR LOVE!!"
Now I'll open the door to show you
A world where no one can stop me, yeah
I will never give up
Until you give in
I'm the only one in the whole world
You can't run away from me that easily
You should already understand this
I will definitely get to you
Hey, your readiness for this session is OK?
My passion will validate my skills
If I don't invade the dungeon anymore, it's no gain
'Cause I won't let you go again
I hear your loud heartbeat, it's louder than mine
Woah
C'mon C'mon C'mon Hands Up
C'mon C’mon C'mon Hands Up
I'm freely "HUNTING FOR LOVE!!"
Woah
C'mon C'mon C'mon Hands Up
C'mon C’mon C'mon Hands Up
'Cause I want to have it all, yeah
Accepting
My selfish ideals
I'm desperately, look, "HUNTING FOR LOVE!!"
'Cause it's time to show you
A world where no one can stop me, yeah
"HUNTING FOR LOVE!!"
Ah, show me properly
The real you
It's enough for me that we go
Through every moment together
Woah
C'mon C'mon C'mon Hands Up
C'mon C’mon C'mon Hands Up
I'm on my own free will "HUNTING FOR LOVE!!"
Woah
