Star you chase
That's almost there
All I want
You'll ma...ke it
Oooooh Yeah! Just do it!
You can rea..ch it! Do it!
You can get it!
I know you can get it!
If you go far far far,
That's OK fine fine fine
You can be the one who you wanted to be!
The scenery you dreamed of
Is now unfolding before your eyes
Go ahead and jump on in
Your wish is my wish as well...
(Hea...rt...)
Even if you're not here, I'll be alright
(Hu...rt...)
Don't look back anymore...
I can say "Cheers to you!"
Grasp the future you want to make true with your own hands
I, I'm alright! I'm okay
"I have to give you a push because you're important to me..."
C, Cheers to you!
I believe that you can shine even more brightly
Hey, since we saw that sky long ago
I've always been wishing for your happiness
Sky we promised
That I wanted to come with ya
Always have
Your back forever
HERE I stand, cheering you you you on
DONT hasitate
LEAVE your fears at the door!
Delete my tears now
You're laughing so well, can't you see?
Debug my pain now
Implementing: Cheer mode!
The future that you're heading towards
The two of us won't be there...
But, no matter what, follow your heart
"Ready! Set! Go! Go! Go!"
I can say "Bye" to you!
I'll wave to you, let me see you off with a smile
You're alright! You're okay
Chase and grab hold of your precious dreams
Bye to you!
I know that you can flap your wings even higher
Since the two of us saw that sky long ago
I've always been wishing for your happiness
Delete my tears now
You're laughing so well, can't you see?
Debug my pain now
