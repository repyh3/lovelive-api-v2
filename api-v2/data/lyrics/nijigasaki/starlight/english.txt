I gotta see the Starlight
You gotta see the Starlight
Let this body heat up, alright??
Even if you wake up from a dream
It's a world that remembers
I will let you stay beside me
I cannot feel, nor think of anything
No.1 in absolute charm
Fly! Fly! to this stage
Come on, the lighting Starlight
(Tonight veiled by Neon)
The spotlight that colors up to the maximum (Oh, shout)
This isn't enough, raise the volume
The high resonance is addictive
Raise it as I yearn for it
Fly! Fly! Call me
The Starlight dancing in time
Lured by a sweet voice, a taste of a maze, alright?
I've chosen this myself, I cannot turn back
I will let someone else be the captive
I cannot feel, nor think anything
No.1 in pleasant feeling
Fly high to that image
Yes! Enchant the Starlight
(Just the guided tonight)
The boldly-colored Spotlight (Oh, feel it)
I will let you stay beside me
I feel nothing. I cannot think
No.1 in absolute charm
Fly! Fly! to this stage
Come on, the lighting Starlight
(Tonight veiled by Neon)
The spotlight that colors up to the maximum (Oh, shout)
This isn't enough, raise the volume
The high resonance is addictive
Raise it as I yearn for it
Fly! Fly! Call me!
The Starlight dancing in time
The starlight dancing in time
Fly! Fly! Call me! The Starlight dancing in time
