Baby, at some point you became my best friend
Even though I should have thought so,
But why... am I heartbroken?
Even though I should have been closest to you
But who are you, who walks next to you on the road?
Cry! Although I don't want to ruin everything
Cry! But my chest hurts
Although I knew how hard it was
But will this relationship have a bad end?
I know, but I can't say it
It's too late.
My heart beats for you
I carefully closed my eyes
There is no turning back now
So finally, ah...
Lonely, lonely, lonely night
I dance with you
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight
This is a pipe love
Lonely, lonely, lonely night
At least in my dreams
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight
Place your shadow on mine
For you? For me
The sad shadow
For you? For me
The shadow of you and me
For you? For me
I don't want to let go of this love
For you? For me
I have to let my love go
Baby, is life black or white?
I would like to always laugh next to you
Cry! Your love story
Filled my heart with tears
All I did was
Pretend I didn't know
My heart beats for you
There's nothing I can do about it
There is no turning back now
So finally, ah...
Only, only, only night
I sing along with you
Falling, falling, falling down
This is unattainable love
Lonely, lonely, lonely night
They will never cross paths again
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight
Place your shadow on mine
Hiding my feelings,
I behaved like an adult
I can't give up
I’m a liar
Who hides what's in her heart
I already...
Lonely, lonely, lonely night
I dance with you
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight
This is a pipe love
Lonely, lonely, lonely night
At least in my dreams
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight
Place your shadow on mine
Only, only, only night
I sing along with you
Falling, falling, falling down
This is unattainable love
Lonely, lonely, lonely night
They will never cross paths again
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight
Place your shadow on mine
For you? For me
The sad shadow
For you? For me
The shadow of you and me
For you? For me
I don't want to let go of this love
For you? For me
I have to let my love go
