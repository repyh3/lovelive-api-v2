May these feelings reach you, connecting our smiles
A message I'll send time and time again
The light inside all of us
Will lead the way by

Let's make them reach
They were days I spent searching only for my mistakes
(It was always like that, being unable to express myself)
Hugging my knees tight, connecting to you, my future began to change
It's all right if we're not close,
I'll communicate in my own style
The moment our eyes looked at each other
The world around us changed
May these feelings reach you, making it across this distance
A message I sent time and time again
I will sing to you
From the deepest of my heart

May these feelings reach you, connecting our smiles
A message I'll send time and time again
The light inside all of us
Will lead the way by
Teletelepathy teletelepathy
Let's make them reach
The truth is that you actually don't know much about me
(It was always like that, being unable to express myself)
Connecting to a dream that I'll be able to laugh tomorrow, my future began to change
The feelings I hid were a barrier
And on my own I was so lonely, lonely
The moment our hands held each other
The world around us changed
May these feelings reach you, weaving together this distance
A message that was supported time and time again
I will sing with you
From the deepest of my heart
Teletelepathy
May these feelings reach you, weaving together our smiles
A message that changed, from the depths of my gaze
The light that is inside of me
Will lead the way by
Teletelepathy teletelepathy
Let's make them reach
Just waiting there and stand doing nothing
Everything will stay the same, so I wanna change!
I'll run forward in a way that feels like "me"
One point, then another point, connected
Becomes one hundred, then one thousand
The power of everyone
Will lead the way by
Teletelepathy teletelepathy
These feelings will reach you, this voice resonates
A message I'll convey time and time again
I will sing to you
From the deepest of my heart

These feelings will reach you, connecting our smiles
A message I'll send time and time again
The light inside all of us
Will lead the way by
