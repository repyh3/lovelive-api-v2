When you're calling me, it really irritates me
When you're calling me, reach me immediately
These feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings blink
Oh, it's a cherry bomb!
Hey, it's so dazzling, it's so mysterious
Your smile gives me great power
Maybe I'm just a little greedy
But I want you to be only mine
You're the only person in this world
Who makes my feel this way
Are you ready...?
It could only be me!
Oh, baby!!!
When you're calling me, it really irritates me
When you're calling me, reach me immediately
These feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings heat me!
This is the taste of love, love
Oh, baby!!!
When you're calling me, I'm like a rocket
When you're calling me, flying towards you
So I just want you to be honest with me
We're two unripe fruits
These feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings blink
Oh, it's a cherry bomb!
Hey, it's a shame, but I'm thinking about you
A fast heartbeat is the best proof of this
Argument and theory
Don't seem to apply to this thing called love
Even I want to make your heart flutter
But handling feelings
Doesn't work at all
Its very existence is a violation!
Oh, baby!!!
When you're calling me, what do you want from me?
When you're calling me, I'm not going to do it
These feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings heat me!
This is the taste of love, love
Oh, baby!!!
When you're calling me, you should know
When you're calling me, that it's simple
No matter what I just want to see you
We're two unripe fruits
These feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings blink
Oh, it's a cherry bomb!
We're at arm's length
But I feel how far away it is
Though I just need you to call me
…Oh, baby
When you're calling me, it really irritates me
When you're calling me, reach me immediately
These feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings heat me!
This is the taste of love, love
Oh, baby!!!
When you're calling me, I'm like a rocket
When you're calling me, flying towards you
So I just want you to be honest with me
We're two unripe fruits
These feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings, these feelings blink
Oh, it's a cherry bomb!
