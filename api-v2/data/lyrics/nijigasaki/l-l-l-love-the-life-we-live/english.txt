Love The Life We Live!!
Let's feel this feeling and connect our dreams to tomorrow
Above this ever-spreading sky
Is a world full of encounters with the unknown
"Where do you want to go?"
"Hey, what do you want to do?"
My heart's starting to beat loudly
For it already knows the answer
I want to share the excitement that has come to life
I want to deliver it more and more, now
Love The Life We Live!!
It's time for our hearts to dance joyfully
We will shine a light on the future
Believe in your feelings
And connect your dreams to tomorrow
Take a leap of faith, let's go!
C'mon, let's go together
Finding The Treasures Around The World
We can always start from where we left off
Because the door will always remain open
Let's swim freely
Let's fly freely
I love it, it won't ever stop!
Let's keep chasing these feelings
I want to hold onto the excitement fate chose for us
There are many hearts, but one is in the shape of a dream
Love The Life We Live!!
I can't stop thinking about how happy I am
I'm filled with expectations for the future
Only our voices can resonate
And create a power we can feel
"Enjoyment!" is the answer!
So let's create it together
Reaching For Dreams All Together
Today is shining more than before because I'm with everyone
No matter where I am, I will never be alone
Because we're all connected by our dreams
Look, it's overflowing with light
It's a moment to think about forevermore
Love The Life We Live!!
It's time for our hearts to dance joyfully
We will shine a light on the future
Believe in your feelings
And connect your dreams to tomorrow
Take a leap of faith, let's go!
C'mon, let's go together
Finding The Treasures Around The World
I want to deliver it, I want to keep my sights on it
I want to tell you it as many times as you want...!!
