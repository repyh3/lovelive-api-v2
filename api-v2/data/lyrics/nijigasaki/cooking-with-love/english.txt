Cooking, Cooking with love......
Cooking, Cooking with you......
If you're happy, I don't need anything else
Stewed feelings in my heart,
Become very-very tasty
Even if we're far from each other, even if the sky is crying,
Your smile is a recipe, so there is nothing to worry about
Welcome back
You're so clumsy sometimes
You're always trying too hard
Remain as you are at all times
Because I want to see you flap your wings
It's better that you think about me
All for you, all for your life
Instead of a spicy thrill in the chest,
Better creamy and soothing
Add a dreamy spice
And wrap the whole thing tightly, kiss
Instead of flambéed hot love,
Gently using meringue, add tenderness
And love, and now food is served...
If you want it, that's the most important thing to me
You always have me, who wants you, this is the first time I feel this way
So thank you
Even if we have rough edges
Even if we have some differences
Always tell it like it is
Because I want to be attracted by your dreamy eyes
The main thing is that you remain yourself
I always wish your happiness
Anxious loneliness that you kept secret
Is proof that you tried hard
The main thing is that one day you shine in the distance
Even if at the same time you'll be unattainable for me
All for you, all for your life
Instead of crispy after fried,
It will be closer to steamy
The flavor is quite weak
Blow to give a slight effect, kiss.
Instead of broiled until sizzling,
Make a sponge with a little love
And these feelings, and now food is served...
Cooking, Cooking with love......
Cooking, Cooking with me......
Cooking, Cooking with love......
Cooking, Cooking with you......
