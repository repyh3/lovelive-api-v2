It'll be sunny tomorrow!
Five seconds before the last chime rings
Our eyes meet, that's our sign to gather
It's time for our daily meeting after school
"Wanna stop by somewhere on the way back?"
It'll be fun no matter where we go, even without a place in mind
When I'm with you, I feel like I can do anything, and I mean it
Our youths may not last forever
Our futures may be uncertain
But deep inside our hearts, I'm sure we'll continue shining, forever and always
I'm so glad we became friends
I'll see you again tomorrow, with a huge smile on my face
When we're together, even the sound of the waves
Shine dazzlingly bright
Even if the sky bursts out into tears, it'll be alright!
We'll just share an umbrella every once in a while!
I'll just share everything with you
That orange sky you see? That means it'll be sunny tomorrow!
Five seconds before the last chime rings
That's our sign to gather round, gather round
As the classroom floods with chatter after school
"You feeling OK today?"
"Did something happen?"
"Let's grab some crepes on the way back!"
When I'm with you, I feel like I can say anything on my mind, and I mean it
Our worries and uncertainties may never come to an end
Just be true to yourself, don't need to hide them from me
The skies clouding your heart will clear up in no time, filling it with wonder
I'm so glad we became friends
We'll say bye-bye for now, but I'll see you again tomorrow!
I'll be right by your side the moment you call out to me
That orange sky you see? That means it'll be sunny tomorrow!
I can feel it deep in my heart
An invisible string connecting us
That took shape right here where it all began
Hand in hand
Our story never ends!
I'm so glad we became friends
I'll see you again tomorrow, with a huge smile on my face
When we're together, even the sound of the waves
Shine dazzlingly bright
Even if the sky bursts out into tears, it'll be alright!
We'll just share an umbrella every once in a while!
I'll just share everything with you
With my precious, precious friend
That orange sky you see? That means it'll be sunny tomorrow!
