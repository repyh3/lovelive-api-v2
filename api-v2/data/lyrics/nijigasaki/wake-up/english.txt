This is quite a familiar melody
Ping-pong pong-pong, ping-pong pong (senpai!)
Is this a dream? Or is it reality?
Ping-pong pong-pong, ping-pong pong (wake up!)
The morning sun slips through my curtains
And this warm bed feels like heaven
There's no escaping, I want to keep on sleeping
This moment still feels like a dream
Oh oh
Your call's coming through, ring ring♪
A happy feeling, right from the morning
I want to see you... I've got to get up
A brand-new day is starting
But you know... my eyelids... still feel so heavy
I rub my eyes and try my best
But a yawn still slips out
Somebody wake me!!
Swaying around in my dreams is some kind of déjà vu​
I can hear a voice calling out to me
Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!!
Oh no Wake up!! Wake up!!
Hey, just give me five more minutes (NO!!)
Just kidding, I'm getting up now (YAY!!)
HELLO good morning♪
Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!!
Let's go, another day of fun is beginning now
I finally woke up, thank you
But, make sure to keep this a secret from everyone
I can't let them find my true face and pride
I can't show them this embarrassing side
Oh oh
I wake myself up with coffee
I love the smell of breakfast in the morning
Seems like it's nice weather again today
I wonder, what should I wear?
But you know... I still... haven't had enough beauty sleep
If I let my guard down,
I start dozing off and end up back in bed
Somebody help me!
I'm being lured in by a soft sleepiness
Being wrapped in my futon fills me with happiness
Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!!
Oh no Wake up!! Wake up!!
I just wanna sleep a little longer (NO!!)
But I can't wait to see you (YAY!!)
And that smile
Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!!
Let's go, surely a wonderful day is waiting
It wasn't supposed to be like this
I can't wake up, it's morning time
Tell me why, it's so embarrassing...
Swaying around in my dreams is some kind of déjà vu​
I can hear a voice calling out to me
Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!!
Oh no Wake up!! Wake up!!
Hey, just give me five more minutes (NO!!)
Please!! Just five more minutes (YAY!!)
I'm kidding, really...
Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!! Wake up!!
Let's go, another day of fun has begun
This is quite a familiar melody
Ping-pong pong-pong, ping-pong pong-pong
Is this a dream? Or is it reality?
Ping-pong pong-pong, ping-pong pong-pong
