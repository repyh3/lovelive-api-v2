In this sparkling world
The passionate dreams hidden in your heart and the desires you have,
The voice that calls within you,
Nobody can take them away from you
Clouds float, it rains and then the sky clears up
And the hidden sun appears
So let's draw the continuation of our dream
Higher, higher, higher now and henceforth
The number of our feelings that are not enough just to draw
Creates the light of hope that will never dry out
We got no limitations, break through all borders
(So you've got to go your way!)
Let's go together, go our way!
Open your soul and start it! A radiant future
We have no limits! If you take the first step, you'll be in a new world
Come on, do it! (Do it!)
Now's your chance, so take it! (Take it!!)
My heart is beating so loud!
(So you've got to go your way!)
Sparkling in full bloom, believe one more time!
We're not wrong! With a resounding voice
Shout your boundless desires, come on
We're driving the processes in our hearts!
OH OH OH OH
Let's go together, go our way!
Our possibilities are endless anytime
The exciting meetings are our destiny
Our vigorous impulse has no brake!
Let's take a big step forward!!
Even if you fall, get back on your feet
We can try again (no problem!)
Cheer up and move forward,
Because we can't settle down (one more time!)
Because! (Because!)
We're right here! (Because!)
It's the only thing I can't refuse... let's go!
This is the signal to start
No matter how many times we remember them,
Our dreams won't just disappear, so we're dreaming up!
By holding hands (Do it!)
And drying our tears (Take it!)
Run forward!
(So you've got to go your way!)
Breaking out of the days of controversy, we're jumping up!
With our eyes, sparkling with a straight spirit
We light our shining path, look,
Now, embracing, we're running forward!!
Oh e ah oh oh e ah
Oh e ah oh oh e ah
YEAH
From today we're rising even faster
We've got to start it right now
Carving out the shining that bound us, we're moving forward
Make some noise, MY HEART!
