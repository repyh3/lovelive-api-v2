"Hey hey let's go!"
Simply put, plain as day, as selfish as you get
Every day, Every night
"Come here at once"
Carefree, self centered there's no doubt of it
Every time, Everywhere
"Don't go away!"
Once in a while I'm wrong, wonder if I'm doing it right?
I'm not so soft at all times
I'm sorry for my baby
Not because everybody tells me it's not alright with you
Don't get me wrong because
You're the only one
Whatever I say always goes!
Always complying with your unreasonable demands
Even if they don't make no sense
I don't mind being bothered by you
That is a no-go, no way
This also is no good at all for you
Hey, would you mind me simply being there
In front of you is that all right?
For every tantrum you throw
You're such a selfish girl
In short at any time and any place
I want you to hog all my attention
cause I love you
Simply put, plain as day, as selfish as you get
Every day, Every night
"Come here at once"
Carefree, self centered there's no doubt of it
Every time, Everywhere
"Don't go away!"
More than anyone else, keep a good eye on me
If you were to look away
I won't be here, any more
Cancel it, I'll be late, I left it on read
Bad humor, egoism, jealousy
You are a full package of it
And I'll be glad to take it all
That thing is no good, at all
No matter what is you won't like
Hey, all of this is all your fault
I would like you to come clean for it
That's barely not enough
You have to put more effort to it
I want you to be forever with me
I wouldn't be able to do it alone
so I need you
That is a no-go, no way
This also is no good at all for you
Hey, would you mind me simply being there
In front of you is that all right?
For every tantrum you throw
You're such a selfish girl
In short at any time and any place
I want you to hog all my attention
Oh
That's no good, no good
No matter whatever I try, no chance
Hey, all of this is all your fault
I would like you to come clean for it
That's barely not enough
You have to put more effort to it
I want you to be forever with me
Always be with me,
I'll always be with you,
All because I love you
I love you
Simply put, plain as day, as selfish as you get
Every day, Every night
"Come here at once"
Carefree, self centered there's no doubt of it
Every time, Everywhere
"Don't go away!"
"Let's be together, forever!"
