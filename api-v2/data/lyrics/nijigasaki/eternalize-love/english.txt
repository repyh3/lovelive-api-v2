"It's because of you that I was able to become who I am"
"It's because of you beside me that I've made it this far"
"If you're here, then we can be together forever"
The seasons are dyed in color; the miracle becomes you
Yes, a single flower blooms in my heart
The changing future, the unchanging past, everything
Dedicated to you, my heart will stay gold
(Just believe in you)
The words I hid deep down are overflowing
Can you hear the restless pounding of my heart?
Now, this moment is glowing
Once again, I ran off towards the excitement
Things like laughing and crying are all new scenes with you
It's not that simple of a story
But it sounds just like us
I want to connect these days together, across eternity
(True Love!)
The warmth of your hand in mine
(True Love!)
Let's swear on forever
(True Love!)
Hug me any day
The map marked with "from now on" is (with you)
Spreading brilliance
(Just believe in me)
The future reflected in the depths of your eyes
Connects the same feelings
Look, this moment is blooming
The excitement has started to blossom once again
Towards the sky, towards the great beyond, true dreams will spread
It's not that light of a story
But even so, I'm going with you
Let's protect these days, forever across eternity
Yet another unforgettable scene is added
Each time, I'll engrave it by your side
It's because of you that I was able to see all of this world
A love that's our color
Eternalize Love!!
Eternalize Love!!
Still, this moment is glowing
Once again, I ran off towards the excitement
It's being conveyed to you, reaching you, as if to connect to the present strongly
Always with you
Now, this moment is glowing
Once again, I ran off towards the excitement
Things like laughing and crying are all new scenes with you
It's not that simple of a story
But it sounds just like us
I want to connect these days together, across eternity
(True Love!)
The warmth of your hand in mine
(True Love!)
Let's swear on forever
(True Love!)
