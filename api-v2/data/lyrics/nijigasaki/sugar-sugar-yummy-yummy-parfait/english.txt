Airy sugar yummy!
It's so sweet harmony for you
Sweets full of charm
With melting cream
I can't contain myself —
It's a girl's habit
Although I would like to give you
The only piece with fruit, but for some reason
I want to take it only for myself... is that bad?
(Temptation!)
If on a strawberry (great!)
Put a slice of muscat,
Each piece will taste different
It's so similar to us
Just wonderful! (So tasty!)
Sugar sugar yummy yummy parfait

Taste of colorful dreams
Sweet! Sweet! Sweets!!
Sweet! Sweet! Sweets!!

I won't let you go, my honey (I love you, yeah)
It's happiness when you hug me (Happy!! Happy!!)
The main thing is not to get caught... it's a secret, isn't it?
Get even tastier,
Sweet! Sweet! Sweets!!
Sweet! Sweet! Sweets!!
Show me more of the future,
Sweet! Sweet! Sweets!!
Sweet! Sweet! Sweets!!
I have a rare relationship with cheese, but unexpectedly it counts well
I didn't know it.
So this sweet trap looks better
Eat!! I just can't stop
I'm drowning in your mischievous smile
Even if I eat everything... is that okay?
(Temptation!)
If on a melon (great!)
Put a little mango and cherries
Everything will shine bright and dazzling
You look just like an idol
So dazzling! (So cute!)

Being greedy and gorgeous
Is too selfish for a girl
I love, I love Sweets!!
I love, I love Sweets!!

I'm in a quandary, my honey (I love you, yeah)
I love you so much, that I want to cry!
It would be better if I could hate you...
I cannot do it
After all this is already predetermined, right?
Familiar aroma and texture,
This my favorite condescending face of yours
Is too perfect
It captivates everyone around
How unfair! (This is frustrating!!)
