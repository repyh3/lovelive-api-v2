Beep bee-beep bee-bee-beep beep boop beep boop
Analog heart
Before I knew it
I was wa-wa-walking somewhere far away
I unpredictably made a bi-bi-big jump
As if I was in a dream
Being updated every day
Is sti-sti-stimulating
Your smile won’t be hidden anymore
I want to see it with my own eyes
I want to reach out
To anyone, anywhere
Even if it’s rainy or windy
My analog heart is still strong
In order to access the future, let’s connect
The courage that jumps out will be a success
Our hearts are all online
Beep bee-beep bee-bee-beep beep boop beep boop
It’s okay, it’s okay to make a mistake
We just need one more step in order to clear this level
Unlock the password of your heart
Your connected analog heart
Your precious analog heart
You never know what's going to happen on the way
It's a big adventure
I want to challenge myself
I want to challenge myself
Always in my heart
"Thank you" and "I'm sorry."
Love is the raw material, analog heart.
The possibilities are endless
I'll convey an important message
Face to face, Say Hello
(beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep)
It's okay to start over. It's okay.
It's okay to do it again and again
I know a spell that works.
I know a spell that works.
I know a spell that works.
The world's a billion light years away
It won't disappear. It won't disappear.
The flame of love is strong.
Someday we'll cross dimensions
Let's sing together
Everyone's smile, smile, smile
I'll cherish it for a lifetime
It's a treasure I'll keep forever
(beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep)
I hope it's sunny tomorrow.
Will there be a rainbow? I doubt it.
I'll see you back here.
We'll be connected, access to the future
The courage to jump out is success
Hearts and minds are online
(beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep)
It's okay to be wrong, it's okay
Just a few more steps to clear
Unlock the heart password
