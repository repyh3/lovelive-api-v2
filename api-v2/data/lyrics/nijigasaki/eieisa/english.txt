A girl always carries a sword on her back
Entrusting the future to her given mission
Time goes by, and looking back at it
She comes to know the meaning of being born, ah
"I'm sure that...because this is my destiny"
She will never lose
Now fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir! (Ho, sir!)
Your heart's got to be strong too!
Fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir! (Ho, sir!)
Polish your weapons once more
When tears spilled, I was left confused
But above all, we need to keep winning together
So don't be afraid to lose
Even though she may lose just one battle
A girl will always get back up every time
Time goes by, and looking back at it
In order to know your "real self", ah
"Please...don't get caught up in the past"
Together, we'll march on
Now fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir! (Ho, sir!)
You got to be stronger than anything else!
Fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir! (Ho, sir!)
I will polish my love once more
If we can all stand up, our bond will deepen
And we can overcome any trial
Now, take down these obstacles
If there are times when someone can't do their best
I'll be stronger so I can help
I will never lose
Now fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir!
Your heart's got to be strong too!
Fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir!
Follow my lead!
Now fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir! (Ho, sir!)
You got to be stronger than anything else!
Fight, c'mon, aye-aye, sir! (Ho, sir!)
I will polish my heart once more
When tears spilled, I was left confused
But above all, we need to keep winning together
So don't be afraid to lose (Ho, sir!)
