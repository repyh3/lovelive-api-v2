Look up to the light and find your dream
As the colorful water surface starts swaying
Ah, my friends, let's learn together
As we gather the future, while the rainbow blooms for Nijigasaki
The sea I look out over shines bright
Examine the wind, and it changes colors
Let's connect our thoughts and smile together
With overflowing hope, as the rainbow blooms for Nijigasaki
Look forward to spring and start to know the richness of the soul
Wear the dazzle of summer and your strength
Listen carefully to autumn and ask yourself the meaning of life
Survive the winter and become stronger throughout the seasons
Surrounded by gentle sunlight
Countless lights start to dance
Let's make our hearts sing as one
As our lives connect and the rainbow blooms for Nijigasaki
The rainbow will always bloom for all time
