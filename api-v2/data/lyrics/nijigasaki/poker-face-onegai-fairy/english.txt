A heart beat, the depths of the eyes
Relaxing is a time to be in high spirits
If you're not interested, you can leave
The bell rings at the beginning of the lesson
I stare at my reflection in the window
Beyond the smile I'm showing, I see...
Red lavender
I knew that the whole time
I want you to turn around someday
I want to know what you think of me! Am I not allowed to know!?
I can't stop the whirlwind of thoughts in my head!
Please tell me!
Hey! Listen to me. I really want you to understand
That my love is endless!
Why do you only notice the trivial things?
This is why I'm sulking
I won't let go of these feelings
Please look at me more
I'm the most confident here. I won't lose.
Please accept my first love's jealousy.
That's if I can say it!
Our classmates are saying things like
"Who do you like?"
You're a little shy, aren't you?
It's finally my time to shine!
But I'm actually feeling shy myself...
So I grip the sleeve of my sailor uniform
It was just the two of us
Dancing in the meadow
But it was just a dream
The thrill and excitement of that day...
That fleeting relationship is over
Please listen to me!
I want you to always look at me, and only me.
I want you all to myself!
Do you know what I mean? Let's start a -LOVE- romance
I don't want to feel lonely.
I always wanted to fall in love. I love everything about you.
You're all I think about.
The more I think about you, the more my heart hurts.
Poker face & Please! Fairy
A flower bloomed on our way home
It can't be just any ordinary flower?
I see it in your eyes
I want to know! I don't want to know!?
I can't stop the whirlwind of thoughts in my head!
Please tell me!
Please tell me!
Hey! Listen to me. I really want you to understand
That my love is endless!
Why do you only notice the trivial things?
This is why I'm sulking.
I won't let go of these feelings
Please look at me more
I'm the most confident here. I won't lose.
Please accept my first love's jealousy.
