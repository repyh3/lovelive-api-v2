Brand New
Brand New World...!!
I won't let this view
Make me feel down
Don't let it get to you!
You can see it by opening your eyes
I have a new feeling
I'm so nervous that I can't sleep
I used to feel lonely
But, I'm not alone anymore
It’s alright, will be alright
We'll aim for the light... It's time to depart!
Ready go!
Whiling holding hands, let's walk together
Towards the rainbow that's waiting for us (Oh Brand New World）
The colors increase every time we dream (always expanding)
Finally we've arrived, and surely
We all believe in miracles (Wish wish, wish wish!!)
Deliver this resonating harmony to the sky
Let's enjoy ourselves (to our hearts content)
While we draw the future
This moment I have dreamed about
Is just about to begin. I just know it...!
It's such a relief to walk towards
All these encounters!
I hear a new sound
I'm excited and that I can't stop
I don't know much about the tomorrow
But I know the wind is already shining
It's alright, will be alright
Open the door... It's time to depart!
Ready go!
Let's go together, each and everyone of us
We'll play a future song (Oh ​​Brand New World)
Every time you wake up, your dreams will bloom (Expanding)
I won't ever hesitate anymore
Let's make a miracle come true (Wish wish, wish wish!!)
Deliver this connected harmony to the sky
Far into the distance
I've noticed my tears
Spill over sometimes
And when it happens,
I should remember today!
