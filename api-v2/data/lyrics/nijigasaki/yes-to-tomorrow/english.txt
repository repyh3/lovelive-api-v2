The answer is "YES", it's okay to hesitate
I'm living while believing
That these ordinary days will turn into light
It's all so dull, this work time
I'll blast through it at double speed
I'm trying to act all cool and detached
But my heart is buzzing with excitement
It's always around midnight
When I can't seem to settle down
The ideal I've drawn out is my style
And my heartbeat keeps rising
Is there no meaning? Do you have no dreams?
No matter how many times I feel this crushing reality
I want to grasp the future ahead, so let's keep leaning forward
The answer is "YES", it's okay to hesitate
We continue to live day by day
Your voice resonates and now we move towards tomorrow
You answer me, your support pushes me forward
I'm living while believing
That these ordinary days will turn into light
It feels so close, but we're still at the starting line
How far until we can see it?
The motion that had been building up for so long
Is shaking more than usual in my heart
Boldly, we try to paint a picture
That has yet to be seen
Breaking into a run, the story from my side
Has finally begun
It's not a lie. It's not a dream.
It's real, no matter how many times I fall
I'll keep leaning forward and go towards the days I want to grab
The answer is "YES", let your pounding heartbeat be your cue
We skip the stairs and head
To the unseen sky, wherever our destination may be
Please answer me, these overflowing feelings are waiting for you
Aiming for the end of this journey
I'm living this once-in-a-lifetime moment
My face is gradually being dyed
By the morning glow
I'm determined and still alive
So every day kicks off
Because with infinite routes, we can draw the world how we want
The answer is "YES", it's okay to hesitate
We continue to live day by day
Your voice resonates and now we move towards tomorrow
You answer me, your support pushes me forward
I'm living while believing
That these ordinary days will turn into light
