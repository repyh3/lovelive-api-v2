Please invite me to that beloved dream
Day by day, the sky turns beautifully
As if to awaken me, the snow, moon,
And flowers gently sway
If you asked me a question, I'd answer with a firm nod
My heart is beating
While searching for a new breeze
Light soars from my outstretched fingertips
I want to take off
And go beyond the limits,
To reach even further
The place where my dancing passion is headed
The infinite futures before me
Please invite me to that beloved dream
I weave the endless flow of time
Continuing to shape my destiny
Yes, within my heart,
I welcome the me of tonight
How many times have we met, vividly
Stirring the silence,
A starry moonlit night runs in color
Every time I chase after it, I get lost and stumble
But, even so, I still
Just head towards a tomorrow with you
All of my doubts and fears are
A single petal of hope
I want to see the scenery that spreads beyond the farthest point
The place where my growing passion longs for
The ever-changing present
Please lead me to my beloved dream
I embrace my doubts along with all my hopes
Like a flower in full bloom
I continue weaving my destiny
The place where my dancing passion is headed
The infinite futures before me
Please invite me to that beloved dream
I weave the endless flow of time
Continuing to shape my destiny
Bringing myself along
To walk right beside you
Yes, within my memories,
I'll engrave this moment's sparkle
Please invite me to that beloved dream
