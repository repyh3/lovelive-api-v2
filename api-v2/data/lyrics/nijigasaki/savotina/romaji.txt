The wavy rocking sight, it grows
Below the sun, exposed
Fukisusabu arashi demo susundeku We go
Kanjiru daichi no Tones
Kodou yadoshita Bones
Mukidashi no netsu hanachi
bursting out our souls
Kick the sand up let it flow-flow
Aru ga mama expose-pose
Horizon ga sou zutto hirogatteku no
Ima abare mau storm-storm
Minagiru Life is born-born
Birds are watching as we're rocking pointy like a thorn-thorn
Savotinas won't dry with no water
Shakunetsu no naka, we burn hotter
Matou kono Spines, we grow flowers
Tsuyoku tada sakihokore
SAVOTINA!!
SAVOTINA!!
We know the thorns all over's our Sign
Kakoku demo sway to no side
Notte kina yo
how could you top-top
Donna toki mo agatteku no
Hatenai daichi no kodou o kanjiteru day and night
I gotta know, let it show
Kakenukeru yo full of life
Kaze o kiri takanaru senritsu
Shadows get long and intense
Sono hikari no saki de
Hora world, it spins
Spinning around and again, so what's gonna happen today?
Netsu sansan giragira
Chuu ni habataku, karamiau
Pushing like a breeze
Saa ikou nobody can stop the lean mean Savotin
Savotinas won't dry with no water
Shakunetsu no naka, we burn hotter
Matou kono Spines, we grow flowers
Azayaka ni sakihokore
Saa ima Rise higher
Kouya ni saku hana We're free
Saa hora Vibe tighter
Shine what you been, what you been
Hikari hanate brighter than the sun
Saa ima Rise higher
SAVOTINA!!
SAVOTINA!!
