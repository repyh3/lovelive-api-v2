When I close my eyes, your smile appears in front of me
I cherish the warmth that I feel when I put my hand on yours
This expression on your face that reflected in my eyes
Even now, it still looks dazzling
That ferris wheel that I rode with you,
The wind, blowing along the sea coast,
A landscape that is constantly changing,
All this now becomes my memories
Before you I'm a sunflower,
Falling in love with you
Thinking about the moments we spent together,
It makes me feel warm
I can remember them at any moment,
After all these are sweet, slightly bitter days
Each of which is important and dear to me
I'm a sunflower in love
In the photographs you and I are smiling at each other.
I hope that we will always, always feel the same
Finding ourselves in a crowd of people, we held hands,
So as not to get lost
Gently but firmly taking my hand,
You also took my heart together with it
Before you I'm a sunflower,
Falling in love with you
After all, remembering even my reddened cheeks,
Those days make me nostalgic
No matter how many seasons change,
My feelings for you will never fade
When I close my eyes, that priceless summer
Appears before my eyelids
Thinking about the moments we spent together,
It makes me feel warm
I can remember them at any moment,
After all these are sweet, slightly bitter days
Each of which is important and dear to me
I'm a sunflower in love
