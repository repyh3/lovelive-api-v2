Silhouettes of gray above the road I walk today
When was the last time I saw the reflection of my face?
It's easy just to say that everything will be okay
But is that the answer that's really deep inside my heart?
It's not always going to be a sunny day, I know
But if I try I might just get a glimpse
I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
Go through the clouds
Fly free towards the sky
The scenery my heart pictured, the road only for me
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming
These words may be easy to say,
But telling the truth is difficult
I don't want to lie to you again
Because I've made up my mind
Life's not always going to be all fun and games, I know
But through the pain, I'll learn to love again
I'm still breathing
My heart keeps beating
Cause I believe that there's so much that I have yet to see
There's a meaning
To everything in our lives
So I'll start believing in myself
Oh
If I follow some narrative someone else came up with,
Then my voice can't reach you
Let this melody echo
In the large sky
Now's the time to spread my wings and fly
I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
I'm still breathing
My heart keeps beating
Cause I believe that there's so much that I have yet to see
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
Go through the clouds
Fly free towards the sky
The scenery my heart pictured, the road only for me
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming
