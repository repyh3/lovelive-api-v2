Silhouettes of gray above the road I walk today
When was the last time I saw the reflection of my face?
It's easy just to say that everything will be okay
But is that the answer that's really deep inside my heart?
It's not always going to be a sunny day, I know
But if I try I might just get a glimpse
I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
Kumo o kiri saite
Sora takaku e fly free
Kokoro egaku keshiki watashi dake no michi
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming
Kotoba de wa kantan ni ieru koto mo
Hontou wa totemo muzukashii kedo
Mou nidoto uso wa tsukitakunai no
Kokoro ni kimeta kotae dakara
Life's not always going to be all fun and games, I know
But through the pain, I'll learn to love again
I'm still breathing
My heart keeps beating
Cause I believe that there's so much that I have yet to see
There's a meaning
To everything in our lives
Shinjite miyou yo jibun no koto o
Oh
Dareka ga kimeta shinario doori ja
Watashi no koe wa todokanai
Hibikase melody
Ano oozora ni
Now's the time to spread my wings and fly
I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
I'm still breathing
My heart keeps beating
Cause I believe that there's so much that I have yet to see
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
Kumo o kiri saite
Sora takaku e fly free
Kokoro egaku keshiki watashi dake no michi
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming
