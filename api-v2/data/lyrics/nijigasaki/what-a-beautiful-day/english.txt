Oh, it's a beautiful day
The scent of fresh buds lifts our hearts
So come on, let's go out!
Even the sun is all good to go!
Oh, it's so lovely day
As I pack this lunchbox, I think of the things you love
And I pour my heart into every bite
I want to laugh and eat it together
I sip the nectar of the blooming flowers and stretch out along the hillside
I keep imagining this perfect day, just for us, again and again
Let's start walking because the wind
Will push us from behind even on the uphill slope
In the greenery, I listen carefully
As the birds and butterflies perform a symphony with their wings
I want to always remember this day, always
If I breathe in and out,
It'd be nice if this voice echoed out
Oh, it's a wonderful day
Though we're a little shy, we hold hands
And match the rhythm of our steps
To the gentle babbling of the brook
As we run through the forest, a carpet of petals spreads out before us
There's a patch of sunlight calling out to me
But I'm feeling sleepy because the early afternoon breeze
Is gently wrapping around me
I'm dozing off again, then saying good morning,
The vast blue sky is no longer just a dream
I wish today could last forever and always
Let's cut and paste it down,
It's connecting now, ah, a page for the two of us
The sky is now dyed a crimson red
And the passing moments turn into silhouettes
It's beautiful, isn't it? I hope we can come here together again
Let's take the road that leads us home,
Guided gently by the evening sun
There's no need to rush so let's take it slow,
Our footprints will guide the way to tomorrow
I want to always remember this day, always
Drawn in the May sky
Is a story just for the two of us
