The sky is dyed in a deep red, as today comes to an end,
Even if I wanted for something to be kept from today, there's nothing that I can do anyway.
"I don't mind," you said, lightly smiling.
The same familiar path to home hasn't changed, but it looks a bit different now.
I'll forget all of it, all this pain and sadness,
Leaving it all behind in today as I move on
As long as you're here with me I'll be alright,
Everyday can be a fresh start.
Tomorrow, I want to meet the 'you' of tomorrow again,
And remember the thrill of seeing you, like that day when we first met.
Tomorrow, and the days after that, we'll fall in love over and over,
Let's go through our first love time and time again.
You joke around, pretending that you don't remember me, and then laugh,
But your casual manners and our conversations overflow with your kindness.
I don't want you to forget the fact that we were happy,
which is a memory that can't be stored inside of a camera.
It's a memory that can't ever be replaced,
More precious than anything.
Tomorrow, I want to meet the 'you' of tomorrow again,
You always show me expressions that I've never seen before.
Tomorrow, I'll be able to fall in love with a 'you' that I don't know.
May our happiness together continue on,
Forever and ever...
Tomorrow, I want to meet the 'you' of tomorrow again,
And remember the thrill of seeing you, like that day when we first met.
Tomorrow, and the days after that, we'll fall in love over and over,
Let's go through our first love time and time again.
Let's go through our first love time and time again.
