I'll cast a magic spell to take you to a land of dreams
Little by little you are getting sleepy
Now, if you look down and see
The fluffy, pillow-y clouds, and a town of sweets
Let's fly around
The planetarium sky
Any dream can come true because everyone is with you
This is just that kind of place
I'd like to grab a star and gift it to you
It's an amulet that will always give you strength
A Fairy Tale Star
Let's think about all the things we like
Each and every one, a treasure
A forest of alarm clocks lies
Over a hill, a bed for my afternoon naps
There's a carnival under the moonlight
Let's dance the night away!
Because everyone is always with me
I can keep dreaming, I'm so full of thanks
I want to put it in words and gift it to you
You will always be my own
Fairy Tale Star
Which dream, which future,
Shall we go visit next?
This is the first time I've felt this way!
A wonderful story
One can't write alone
There's more to it, let's keep writing
More, and more!
Let's sing together...
Any dream can come true because everyone is with you
This is just that kind of place
I'd like to grab a star and gift it to you
It's an amulet that will always give you strength
A Fairy Tale Star
Lululu Lululu Lululu...
