Dreaming more, let's all move forward together
Dreaming a lot, let's all move forward together
Let's stretch out our hands as far as we can
Because that's what we decided that day
Even though it was impossible,
We tried to chase our desires
That's why we became connected and our circle expanded
The thrill shone
In our hearts all the time, didn't it?
Seems like we can go this far with you who is always laughing
Let's dream together all the time, all the time
Let's dream forever (Ah, singing, dreaming)
If you run right through them,
You'll break through your limits before you know it
I won't give it up, my heart that I want to chase
Will change the tomorrow (Singing now)
In these precious days through which I run with you
The blue of the sky seems so dazzling
I believe, I believe that we can do anything
The power of love is strong, it's stronger than anything
SINGING, DREAMING, NOW!
Wow wow! SINGING, DREAMING, NOW!
You taught me
That there are ways to different doors
That you wouldn't even notice yourself
Which world will we go to next time?
There must be, must be something waiting for us there
Let's draw a new dream (Ah, singing, dreaming)
I'm so glad I met you who I can have passionate conversations with
I'm really happy
The places we long to go, the dreams we aim for
And our personal feelings, it's okay that they're different (Dreaming now)
Let's talk to you, encourage each other
And sing, turning our eyes to the sky
I believe, I believe that you can do it
The voice that radiates love will never fade
Our dreams may seem far away, but someday we'll grasp them
Never forget about this
Ah, I'm so glad I met you who I can have passionate conversations with
I'm really happy
The places we long to go and our personal feelings,
It's okay because they're different (I love everyone!)
If I run through them with you,
We'll break through our limits before we know it
I won't give it up, my heart that I want to chase
Will change the tomorrow (Singing now)
In these precious days through which I run with you
The blue of the sky seems so dazzling
I believe, I believe that we can do anything
The power of love is strong, it's stronger than anything
SINGING, DREAMING, NOW!
Wow wow! SINGING, DREAMING, NOW!
Dreaming more, let's all move forward together
Dreaming a lot, let's all move forward together
Dreaming more, let's all move forward together
Dreaming a lot, come on, let's go, come on, let's go.
