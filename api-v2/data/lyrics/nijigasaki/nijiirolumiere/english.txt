(Eh?! Genius Kasumin!!)
"Hop-hop" goes a mochi-pounding bunny (so cute!!)
Then a playful kitten with no restraint (so cute!!)
There's a wild, high-energy monkey full of life (so cute!!)
Jumping high, jumping free,
Heartbeat racing, heartbeat racing
An absurdly outlandish spell
Is cast towards those fluffy clouds
With my boundless energy,
I want to stay with you forever
"Let's go"
In a bright, carefree mood, my heart bursts with happiness
With this heart-pounding surprise, I'll turn these boring days to one's full of wonder
We're riding on colorful feelings, carrying an extraordinary dream
Let's all chant together "Rainbow-Colored☆Lumiere"
Isn't it wonderful?
"Here we go, everyone!!"
