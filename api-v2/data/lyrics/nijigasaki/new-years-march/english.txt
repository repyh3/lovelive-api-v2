Come on, let's go! Let's step out! To that place that's illuminated by the morning sun
Come on, let's go! Let's have some fun! Fortune favors those who smile
Come on, let's go! Let's dream of a tomorrow full of hopes
Come on, let's go! Let's make our best year ever a reality
HEY! HEY! Let's dream together, you and me!
(January) It's a new start. (Smile) Let's play the "fukuwarai" game together
(February) On Valentine's Day, we find no peace until we give chocolate filled with our love; just kidding!
(March) On the holiday of dolls (March!)
All the girls dress up cute and celebrate
(April) In the new academic semester, when the cherry blossoms bloom, (Yes!) let's continue to walk forward step by step
The sunlight that breaks through the foliage sways in the May wind - Let's carefully stretch out our hands to the green trees
Rainy drops shine in the June rain - Let's open our umbrellas and dance
Come on, let's go! Let's have some fun! The curtain rises
Let's start! So let's start our future
This is your (Yes!) and my (Yes!) new story
Let's go! Let's start! Shine; let's make this year great
We can do it! We can definitely do this
HEY! HEY! Let's dream together, you and me!
(July) Tanabata! Fire works! This is summer! A sparkling beach!
We are free to have fun this way!
(August) I want to relax on the veranda in the afternoon with the sound of swaying bells
(September) On the full moon night the hum of insects can be heard; at the beginning of autumn miscanthus sways in the wind
(October) On sports day, I dash with all my might with you! (DASH!) Our passionate feelings don't stop
In the cold November wind, eating fried sweet potatoes warms the heart
December is Christmas! It's perfect if we have meat!
Listen, let's (together) have a party!
Come on, let's go! Let's have some fun! The curtain rises
Let's connect! So let's start our future!
This is a story full of (Yes!) dreams (Yes!) and hopes
Let's go! Let's start! Shine, to light up the whole world
Let's sing, we will sing!
Let's do something fun anytime
We're together for 365 days a year
Let's sing about our dreams with power
To deliver them to the sky during the first sunrise
Come on, let's go! Let's step out! To that place that's illuminated by the morning sun
Come on, let's go! Let's have some fun! The curtain rises
Let's start! So let's start our future!
This is your (Yes!) and my (Yes!) new story
Let's go! Let's start! Shine; let's make this year great
Let's overcome this! So let's start our future
Let's set our goals (Yes!) higher (Yes!) than last year
Let's go! Let's start! Flap your wings; let's make this our best year yet
We can do it! We can definitely do this
Come on, let's go! Let's step out! To that place that's illuminated by the morning sun
Come on, let's go! Let's have some fun! Fortune favors those who smile
Come on, let's go! Let's dream of a tomorrow full of hopes
Come on, let's go! Let's make our best year ever a reality.
