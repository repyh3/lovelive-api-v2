Let's ride the wave!
Are you ready to dive headfirst in and enjoy every last bit
Of these emerald-like burning tropical days?
The record-breaking heat of our love sends shivers across my skin
And each promise I make will surely become a precious memory
I want to feel happy, and my heart is burning with excitement
Whenever I'm with you, everything becomes so much fun
What the? What the? Tell me, what is this feeling?
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Neon lights and the swaying magic of summer
Whoa... Summer time
Happy! Darling! Shake and jump around
Love Love Love
Isn't a smile in love the sweetest thing?
Whoa... Summer time
Where shall we play next? Beyond the door lies our paradise
The sun surely knows what our reward plans are
You and I - I don't want to do anything but "have fun"
The island's already there waiting for us, come on, let's run!
What the? What the? What's this feeling that's pounding so loudly?
Whoa Whoa Whoa
While rocking those colorful earrings
Whoa... Summer time
Joyful! Darling! Let's drink juice side by side
Love Love Love
A girl in love is wonderful, you know?
Whoa... Summer time
Let's ride the wave!
I've ignored your message hundreds of times,
But I have finally realized
I've given myself away a thousand times,
I just can't lie and it's driving me crazy
I can't hold it in anymore so let's just blame it on the summer heat
What the? What the? Tell me, what is this feeling?
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Neon lights and the swaying magic of summer
Whoa... Summer time
Happy! Darling! Shake and jump around
Love Love Love
Isn't a smile in love the sweetest thing?
Whoa... Summer time
What the? What the? What's this feeling that's pounding so loudly?
Whoa Whoa Whoa
While rocking those colorful earrings
Whoa... Summer time
Joyful! Darling! Let's drink juice side by side
Love Love Love
A girl in love is wonderful, you know?
Whoa... Summer time
