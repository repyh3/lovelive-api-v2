What distance separates me from you?
If I wear high heels, will I be able to reach your lips?
By the time my short hair falls on my shoulders,
I want to become a woman who is worthy of you
Even if this wish comes true and we become connected,
I want you to always think about me first
I remain my cutest self all the time for you
Of course it's because I love you so much
I will be the perfect lady from morning until evening
I want to have a perfect love, even if I need to stretch out on my tiptoes a little for this
To make our meeting place easy to understand at first glance,
I want to be the most fashionable when I'm waiting for you
Even this ordinary day, the same as everything else,
I want to make special for you and me
I remain my cutest self also for my own sake
Becoming more and more beautiful, I will eventually captivate you
The excitement I felt, when we first met, will never fade, no matter how many years pass
I want to have a wonderful love, let's love each other forever
I remain my cutest self all the time for you
Of course it's because I love you so much
I will be the perfect lady from morning until evening
I want to have a perfect love, even if I need to stretch out on my tiptoes a little for this
Even if I need to stretch out on my tiptoes a little for this
