What you gonna do
Shabadabadaa
Some things can only be done right no-no-no-no-now
I want, want, want to cherish my beloved friends
Hearts flutter with every passing moment
Together forever
Oops, developing a brain fever
I want you
I need you
Chupi chupi chu
This is the age where you'll be happy no matter what you do (Yes)
Don't worry
Be happy
Chupi chupi chu
In short, it's a show that fortune comes in by laughter
Things that don't make sense will become meaningful (C'mon! Work hard!)
In other words, (Hey) run with (Hey) all of your strength
On your marks, get set!
And, go!
Some things can only be done right no-no-no-no-now
I want, want, want to cherish my beloved friends
Hearts flutter with every passing moment
Together forever
Oops, developing a brain fever
Let's put tho-tho-tho-those troubles aside for now
This song is so tiring, just like a tongue twister!
Take your time advancing and retreating
Don't forget to be kind every day
A smile will enrich your life
Forever☆
Wǒ ài nǐ
Danke schön
Chupi chupi chu
In short, this is a very strange age (Yes)
Abracadabra
The pain is gone
It's a show where the pain will fly away
There will occasionally be nasty things (C'mon! Work hard!)
But with all your heart (Hey) and all your strength (Hey)
Look up and laugh it all away
Look over there now!
Maybe one day the number of things you ca-ca-ca-can't do will increase?
If that's the case, it'll be o-o-o-o-okay, I'll help you
Run forward recklessly
Aim for Machu Picchu?
This passionate fever is quite hot
Let's put tho-tho-tho-those troubles aside for now
To put it simply, ABCDEFGHI love you!
"Who do you choose?"
"I can't choose only one of you"
It's better when everyone's the favorite
Every day of the week☆
Holding your hand tightly, and I won't let go (heave-ho, heave-ho)
A-i-u-e thank you
Ka-ki-ku-ke comical
Ding-dong kang-con
Chupi chupi chu
Decorate every minute and second in 365 days
Crying, laughing, angry? It's so hectic
These fulfilling moments are very precious
Who should take the blame?
That's right, everyone should!
Some things can only be done right no-no-no-no-now
I want, want, want to cherish my beloved friends
Hearts flutter with every passing moment
Together forever
Oops, developing a brain fever
Let's put tho-tho-tho-those troubles aside for now
This song is so tiring, just like a tongue twister!
Take your time advancing and retreating
Don't forget to be kind every day
A smile will enrich your life
Forever☆
What you gonna do
