Hey you, what's wrong?
You keep glancing at me
Are you really that...
(Interested in me? I know right?)
(I'm right in front of you, do you understand?)
All day and night, day and night, and all day all night
Do you love me, love me?
Being only sweet and enticing is nonsense, it won't ever work,
So I'll be bitter, bitter to the point of being alluring, that sounds good
(Are you intrigued? I know right?)
(I'm right in front of you, do you understand?)
All day and night, day and night, and all day all night
Do you love me, love me?
Wherever you go, it's my world, I want to get fired up
I love you too ♡
But I won't turn around for you
Do you want me?
Hey! make me excited!! I'll send you deeper into your daydreams, this obsession
Hey! make me excited!! I'm the pearl that everyone's searching for
NaNaNa..
I'll make your heart pound and flutter about ♡
Hey! make me excited!! Tell me now, tell me now
Hey, even with all that, do you still want me?
My life is for me to decide,
I know
How to be this world's brightest star
I know best, that's why I'm special (Fantastic!)
I've locked on to you, I'll make you weak
I'll drive you insane with desire with my magic
I'll do it all day and night, day and night, and all day all night
Do you love me, love me?
I'm polishing up my body and heart, I'm still far away from my ideals
I can't let it end like this
But if it's the two of us then...
Hey! make me excited!! I'll draw you closer and closer
Hey! make me excited!! show me now show me now
C'mon, show me your true self
NaNaNa..
There's no other person like me, I'm the only one, that's how I am
I'm headstrong?
But babe, you don't hate that, don't you
Do you want me?
Hey! make me excited!! I'll send you deeper into your daydreams, this obsession
Hey! make me excited!! I'm the pearl that everyone's searching for
NaNaNa..
I'll make your heart pound and flutter about ♡
Hey! make me excited!! Tell me now, tell me now
Hey, even with all that, do you still want me?
