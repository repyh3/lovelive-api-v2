Just like a Rainbow Colors...
The twinkling from the constellations
Keep spilling down from the sky
Even though I close my eyes, they're so bright
They shine, they race across so passionately
If I were by myself
I never would have known
All of the weaknesses, pain, or gloominess
I like it when you smile (as you're by my side)
And say that you like me
How about white or black, or Yes or No?
If it's never just that simple
Then no one actually knows the true answer
So let's create a future just as we want it
A vivid world, hey, can you tell me
Why my heart starts racing when we're together?
My choice as my new self
Will add color to my tomorrow
Find a way, if I'm with you
It's not so bad being lost
There's not one right answer or shine
Just like a Rainbow Colors...
Wanting to protect
And being protected
They're both so endlessly passionate
They overflow deep within me
I thought maybe
"Being alone isn't so bad"
But I didn't know
That I would like (as you're by my side)
The time that I spent with you
Past or present, that's just not enough
There are things that I'm not so sure of
These feelings won't change in the future
So let's create that future with everyone
A vivid encounter could happen at any moment
And become an irreplaceable memory
These days keep changing when I'm with you
But I want to see more of what we'll do tomorrow
Light a way, if I'm with you
I feel like I can do anything
Ah, let's surpass common sense and our limits
So we can shine like Rainbow Colors...
Just like a Rainbow Colors
Oh...
I'm feeling so dizzy
Remembering how big this universe really is
It's a miracle that I'm performing right now
Isn't it just so exciting to see?
A vivid world, hey, can you tell me
Why my heart starts racing when we're together?
My choice as my new self
Will add color to my tomorrow
Find a way, if I'm with you
It's not so bad being lost
There's not one right answer or shine
Just like a Rainbow Colors...
