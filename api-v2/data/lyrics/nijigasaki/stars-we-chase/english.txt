I used to look above at stars, and chase
Never had to doubt what I could take
Now I've found it's further than it seemed
The light gets smaller, my eyes to a closure
When did it happen? Turned away my face
When did it happen? Pain increasing
Shadow walk and dealing, truth inside revealing
Still, a part of me's seeking that feeling
Dreams in the sound I made for you
Go 'round, come returning through me
Where this light shines so bright, you showed
It's back and now
Take your hand out, we can reach
Always been there to be freed
It's getting loud, on to a scream
We're starting this brighter tomorrow
Try this
Every color shown, bright in the star
From here we can find
Letting us shine
Don't hide your brightness
Approval of someone to feel complete
Honesty was gone to say the least
Many things about us are the same
The distance for us is hard to decipher
Why did it happen? I've imagined your face
Thinking about this lonely feeling
Standing still exceeding, urge and drive increasing
I've gotta be by you and speaking
A little time has been taken
I find it was time we needed
When our minds are aligned, we know
That star's in view
Let's restart it, you and me
Walking on our new story
I feel your voice, my melodies
Don't worry when struggling to follow
Find this
Allow this
Take your hand out, we can reach
Always been there to be freed
It's getting loud, on to a scream
We're starting this brighter tomorrow
Try this
Every color shown, bright in the star
From here we can find
Letting us shine
Don't hide your brightness
