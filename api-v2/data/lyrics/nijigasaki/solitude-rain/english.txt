The thunder keeps echoing in my heart
As all the emotions inside of me start spilling out.
I will never lose sight
Of my feelings ever again.
The raindrops that keep falling from the sky
Slide down my cheeks
And before I knew it
It gently washes away
The mask that had been covering my heart
There was something inside of me
That refused to change
But then, I finally realized it
As I powerfully awaken
Let's keep running, barefoot
I won't run away from myself anymore
When I'm able to accept and embrace
All of my worries and fears
I'll be able to journey into the blindingly bright sky
I've always been so, so afraid
Of facing who I really am
But I don't have to force myself any longer
To play that perfect somebody that I'm not
The curtain closes on those lies
They flow forth, without end
I want to continue weaving the tale
Of these feelings that belong to me alone
They shine powerfully
I want you to look me in these eyes
I won't do as much as run away from any heart of mine
If I can carry all of my fears and weaknesses
Atop the voice spilling from my throat
Then I'll be able to play my song out to the blindingly bright sky
I'm fully prepared
To become the only version of me
You'd find in the world
So, let my reality in my colours
Be reflected in those eyes
I want to touch your heart
As I powerfully awaken
Let's keep running, barefoot
I won't run away from myself anymore
When I'm able to accept and embrace
All of my worries and fears
I'll be able to journey into the blindingly bright sky
Soon, the rain will stop
"Hello, This is me."
