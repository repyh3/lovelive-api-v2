Hey! Love! Come on! Kasumin!
Yes! Come on! Hello! Kasumin!
Let’s go again today, with smiles of the highest level!
I polish this diamond
Aren’t I the number-one cutest? I mean, I’m the best!
Because I’m always working my hardest
Hey! Love! Come on! Kasumin!
Yes! Come on! Hello! Kasumin!
Arch enemies! Rivals! A perfect counter-attack.
Your worried face appears in my eyes and I smirk…ah!!
I’m hopeless… but that’s a secret, so…
Please root for me, at any rate☆
Oh, the flashing, sparkling future got me choked up
(It’s an important place) Or something like that
Let’s sing a song loaded with lots of wishes and feelings
This diamond sparkles…
The heart-pounding doesn’t stop – once again, today is the best!
Because this is something I love
Because we are all together, even when we’re sad
We can do our best! It’s so much fun☆
Ah, when you get choked up by my smile, twinkling with light
(I’ll take you to) a special place
Let’s sing a song that carries lots of hope and glitter
This diamond sparkles…
Hey, everyone! Are you ready? (Yeah!)
“L-O-V-E Kasumin” Here we go! One-two!
L-O-V-E Kasumin
L-O-V-E Kasumin
L-O-V-E Kasumin
L-O-V-E Kasumin
Success!
Hey, do you think I was just a little bit too cute there?
Maybe I just annoyed everyone…
Take my hand, and the story starts now
Come with me, so we won’t be late!
Oh, the flashing, sparkling future got me choked up
(It’s an important place) Or something like that
Let’s sing a song loaded with lots of wishes and feelings
This diamond
Ah, when you get choked up by my smile, twinkling with light
(I’ll take you to) a special place
Let’s sing a song that carries lots of hope and glitter
This diamond
This diamond sparkles…
