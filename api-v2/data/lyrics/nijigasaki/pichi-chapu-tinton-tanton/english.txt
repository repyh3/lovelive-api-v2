The drizzle hides the blue sky
And softly sings to me
Raindrops sparkle on the glass,
And a sign begins to reach my ears
Rainy days go on and on, but they're part of my chapter
Even the water strider swims, whispering a-i-u-e across the surface
With my favorite boots, I'm ready to go;
The story is about to begin moving
These blessings are overflowing
Now let the flower of my heart bloom
Let's start running!
Pitter-patter-tip-tap-tip-tap
With a pop of my umbrella, a melody jumps up
Dancing along the rhythm,
We weave with the rain's fairies
Pitter-patter-tip-tap-tip-tap
If I hum a tune, then even
The most ordinary days turn into sparkling scenes
Today, the rain becomes my stage
The whispers brushing against my cheek
Make the morning dew shimmer
That single drop, fading with a plop,
I wonder where it goes?
Let's go on a grand adventure,
So no one can call us a frog in a well
Froggies bounce with a boing-boing-boing, on three, boing-boing-boing
When I chant a strange little spell,
A bit of courage starts to rise in me
So, let's step forward
Pitter-patter-tip-tap-tip-tap
It's pouring down a thrilling symphony
Let it echo throughout the monochrome city,
Now soaring high, past the clouded sky
Pitter-patter-tip-tap-tip-tap
When I hum, even uneven rhythms
Turn into sparkling melodies
Today, the rain becomes my stage
Even in sad times,
Let's still try to smile
When I peer into the water's mirror,
A clear and boundless unknown sky appears
Rainbow-colored tears make
The flowers of the future bloom
Let's start running!
Pitter-patter-tip-tap-tip-tap
With a pop of my umbrella, a melody jumps up
Dancing along the rhythm,
We weave with the rain's fairies
Pitter-patter-tip-tap-tip-tap
If I hum a tune, then even
The most ordinary days turn into sparkling scenes
Today, the rain becomes my stage
