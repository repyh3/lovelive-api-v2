I want to feel the feelings just as they are born right now
The sound of rain is getting louder, my shoes are getting wet
Crossing beyond the blue sea
No matter what sky or melody it is,
It's simply beautiful just the way it is
The desire that stirs deep in my chest
When I add the wings of courage, I'll put it into my voice
Feel this unique moment,
And let's sent it directly to that heart
Vera passione
"Tesoro mio!"
Yes, let's engrave this moment together
Even as the seasons pass, this melody will bloom eternally
"Ti voglio bene!"
Yes, this moment will become the thread that weaves the future
I want to sing everything
I feel in this present...!!
The salty wind brushes against my cheeks
I am running over the blue sea
Surely, there won't be another day like today
I just want to fully feel the now as it is
Crossing the celestial bridge,
My heart has been satisfied
We laugh and bloom
Like a garden in full bloom
The encounters that repeat over time,
Each one of them is a treasure to me
I want to cherish the feelings
That arise from this moment and place
Tua emozione
Una volta sola
I want to embrace this moment
Even as the seasons pass,
I will always care about you
"Tesoro mio!"
Yes, let's engrave this moment together
Even as the seasons pass, this melody will bloom eternally
"Ti voglio bene!"
Yes, this moment will become the thread that weaves the future
The feelings that are in my chest expand
Ah, I want to sing everything
I feel in this present...!!
Cara Tesoro
