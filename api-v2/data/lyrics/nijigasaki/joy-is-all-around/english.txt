Nanana nana..
I feel the blinding sun, set up high
Rays flood in my eyes
I'm racing to the site
Our promise ignites
(My sunrise)
I leave my room and I'm on my way
Toward excitement as I check the page
On the newest menu, brief in stay
Got so many things I wanna say out loud
And so many things I wanna ask about
There's so many thoughts on my mind
(so many thoughts)
And even if it's plain and mundane
All the same, it's such a special day
If I open up that door, speed unbinds
Everyone has picked a plate resembling their style
Fun is in sight, happiness is shown with a smile
Lovely day
Shanana nana, shanana nana
Joy is all around, joy is all around
I forget about the woes, I had in mind
They don't bother me no more
Shanana nana, shanana nana
Joy is all around, joy is all around
Blinding light, glittering so bright, you're my sunshine
Looking up outside, I see an orange sky
Conversation heating, heating up and now
It's about who has caught your eye (That storyline)
I wonder how to steer, navigate
Every case and every different state
Love is not a straight line easy to trace
Understated moments are so precious in our lives
Still undefined
Topic-shiftings, all misaligned
Shiny day
Shanana nana, shanana nana
Joy is all around, joy is all around
I'm with everyone, we talk
Finding the answers, a moment we embrace
You're the only ones, you're the only ones
Who can shine a light
Looking, looking bright
Gleaming over sadness, by my side
Love and everything we all adore
Or the studies, what a chore
Dramas or new make up and more
Though out of time, we got stories to explore
Shanana nana, shanana nana
You are like the light coming into sight
Best of all, got so many things we can highlight
Born and grew in different ways
Diverge in tastes and what we each wear
With a common dream and our connected time
All of our smiles and every tear weaves our bond, it's so sublime
Lovely day
Shanana nana, shanana nana
Joy is all around, joy is all around
I forget about the woes, I had in mind
They don't bother me no more
Shanana nana, shanana nana
You are like the light coming into sight
Glittering so bright, you're my sunshine
Shiny day
Shanana nana, shanana nana
Joy is all around, joy is all around
I'm with everyone, we talk
Finding the answers, a moment we embrace
You're the only ones, you're the only ones
Who can shine a light
Looking, looking bright
Blinding light
Glittering so bright, you're my sunshine
Nanana nana...
