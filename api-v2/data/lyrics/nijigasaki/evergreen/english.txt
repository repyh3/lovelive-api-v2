I close my eyes and the scenery of my hometown comes to mind
Just with that I'm calm and at ease
Even you or anyone would be, too
This faraway town that I came from
For sure this will not change:
The wind blowing through the Earth, and the people who live there, too
The sky and the Evergreen that spread everywhere
The setting sun welcomes all!
I want to give it a hug, just like that; and everybody's heart, too
Now everyone, I'll sing this wish out!
The room is lit with the moonlight shining outside
I was so happy when we all smiled today
Even if there is a day when we all part ways
This unchangeable present will not come twice!
The Evergreen song that has always been loved
The humming melody that envelopes everyone!
And I hope to be like that! Hope for my future self
And right now,
I'm singing this wish out!
Everyone is drawing the things they cherish
Let's dance while we think too
La la la...
Under this clear blue sky with no cloud at all
Let's walk forward looking up
And never ever letting go of our hands...
The sky and the Evergreen that spread everywhere
The setting sun welcomes all!
I want to give it a hug, just like that; and everybody's heart, too
Right now, I'll sing this wish out!
La la la la la...
