A glittering Sun shower
Behind the curtain "I've been waiting for a lunch break"
There's a growling sound, who's stomach was that?
Our bellies don't lie - it's lunchtime!
A table full of tasty treats
Our chatter never ends
We're on the rooftop and a nap sounds nice; it's a paradise
It's a warm and sunny day (softly)
It's a happy time for us
Fluttering, fluttering, even the curtain is dancing (Yes)
Time flies by in the blink of an eye (Come back)
It's a warm and sunny day (softly)
It's a heart-pounding time!?
Sparkling, sparkling - youth is happening now
My excitement won't stop, nor will this happiness
I want to stay like this forever
"There's still plenty of free time!"
Tick-tock, tick-tock
The second hand keeps ticking "wait, not yet, it's still lunch break"
My heart beats fast, I'm lost in a trance
Dazed and head over heels, a dreamy rendezvous
Fifth period is almost here
Did we have homework? (Wait, did we?)
There's no time for this, I'm in a full panic mode
It's a warm and sunny day (shining bright)
It's a happy time for us
We're taking big steps forward, just like climbing stairs (Yes)
Each day passes by in the blink of an eye (High five)
Is this feeling what they call love!? (How sparkly)
It's a heart-pounding time!?
One by one, adding up, our memories are growing
Let's create even more of this happiness
I just want to hold onto it
"My heart won't stop racing"
Things don't always go smoothly and not everything will go our way, but
We can always laugh out loud together with our friends
By afternoon my heart feels refreshed
This ordinary everyday life has
Become irreplaceable to me
Look at this, look at that, there's so much of everything
We're headed towards a sparkling, shining future (Yes! Jump)
I just want a little more time, please (I'm praying)
It's a warm and sunny day (softly)
It's a happy time for us
Fluttering, fluttering, even the curtain is dancing (Yes)
Time flies by in the blink of an eye (Come back)
It's a warm and sunny day (softly)
It's a heart-pounding time!?
Sparkling, sparkling - youth is happening now
My excitement won't stop, nor will this happiness
I want to stay like this forever
