Come on everyone, let’s get fired up again!
Everybody follow me  Come on!!!
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
‘‘I thought about it’’ there’s no answer
Then, rather than thinking forget about it all
Just gather only the fun things
Go further tomorrow than yesterday and today
Rather than aiming for your goals, shoot as much as you can
Puns and rap and energy are life
Feelings are more important than skill
Ah, days like today where I can tell a silly joke are
an ordinary day of bliss, the same as usual
You don’t laugh because it’s fun
You laugh, and that makes it fun!
Before you realize, everyone’s smiling
Tears and the like have flown off somewhere
There’s nothing that’s boring
It all depends on you
Anytime anywhere you can be excited
I’m the genius of fun
Sometimes there are things that hurt
Yeah, they might happen again and again
But those experiences will turn into fuel
And someday I’ll turn into an unbeatable girl
At first, I really was a crybaby
Far too many things had me down
I detested that part of myself
But now, I want to become stronger
Ah, everyone has nights where they can’t sleep
But eventually, the light will shine through; the morning will come again
You don’t cry because it’s sad
You’re sad because you cry
From things looking down, tears about to spill
I’ll hold my head higher, and look up
In times when it feels like I’m gonna be crushed
If I took back, everyone is
there for me, so it’s okay
I’m not alone, isn’t that right?
Fortune and happiness will come to those who smile
We’re connected by a chain of smiles
Expanding out to everywhere!
You don’t laugh because it’s fun
You laugh, and that makes it fun!
Before you realize, everyone’s smiling
Tears and the like have flown off somewhere
There’s nothing that’s boring
It all depends on you
Anytime anywhere you can be excited
I’m the genius of fun
Ai-san’s out of this world!
