Walk in a dream with me
Why is it?
You weren't supposed to be here today
My heart might break
While I'm hiding the feelings that I can't say
Your private account and your secret hobbies
When it comes to you, I know everything
I bought the shoes you were looking at.
Come home with me right now
Who are you looking at? Don't do that
There are unplanned stories that are not on the schedule,
But I can't tell them. That's why I want you to understand (Fu fu fu fu)
I see all the time you sparkle
I want to lock you inside me forever
I want to hug you tightly, so that no one can see you
Right, here is my "walking dream"
Again and again
I save new data about you
When I count them on my fingers,
This is my special time on an ordinary night
Fortune telling for compatibility, horoscopes and even your profile
Everything is just perfect
I want to tell you that there is such a thing as the fate
I can't wait any longer, it's true
Who is it? Don't do that
The perfect story I dreamed of
Is just the two of us and no one else (Fu fu fu fu)
Someday you will understand
Today you made a small mistake
I like you more than just liking you, it seems there is no going back
Right, but here is my "walking dream"
I can't send you a message
So I closed my eyes, here is my "Walking Dream"
Right, here is my "Walking Dream"
"Walking Dream" "Walking Dream"
"Here is my walking dream, so brilliant, exciting and painful"
"Here is my walking dream, which I constantly see, no matter if we're apart or close"
"Here is my walking dream, so brilliant, exciting and painful"
I like you, it's not good.
I'm just looking at you from the outside
Who are you looking at? Don't do that
There are unplanned stories that are not on the schedule,
But I can't tell them. That's why I want you to understand (Fu fu fu fu)
I see all the time you sparkle
I want to lock you inside me forever
I want to hug you tightly, so that no one can see you
Right, here is my "walking dream"
Walk in a dream with me
