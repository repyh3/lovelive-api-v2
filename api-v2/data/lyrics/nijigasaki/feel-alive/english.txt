Hey, are you ready to go with us?
No more rules, No more rails
The free world is now spreading out before us
We go, listen
The chains fell from us, we all opened the bird cage
Hey, can I trust me? It's beginning, I can fly free
(The endless sky) Of course I don't have a map
(Where are we going?) This is my first experience
Let's enjoy this landscape that we're feeling
Because back in the days, look,
Laid tracks had been pushing us forward
Now I understand that it was not in vain
Look for the better days
Never weighed down
New wings, we know we got it
So, we can fly
Ride the wind and go to the unknown world
Just keep going forward together
Let's go where our hearts will beat the way they should
This feeling fills me endlessly
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
Even if we get lost, I'm sure everything is so fine
Shout: "I!"
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
Look that, it ain't hitting me yet
I'm flying by myself, of my own free will
(I keep moving forward) Wherever I am
I can't blame anyone (anymore, anymore)
The breaking dawn, look (look)
Why is it, the same sky (why) looks so bright?
Now I understand that it was wonderful
Look for the destiny
All day, all night burning it in your eyes
So, free them
Even if you don't look for me, I will be in your hearts
This feeling circulates through my body
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
Although sometimes we expect storms, then everything is so fine
Say: "I!"
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
The sky's shining bright, oh baby
Even on our uncertain journey, the landscape before us is absolutely undeniable
Yeah, we found a way
Ride the wind and go to the unknown world
Just keep going forward together
Let's go where our hearts will beat the way they should
This feeling fills me endlessly.
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
Even if we get lost, I'm sure everything is so fine
Shout: "I!"
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
