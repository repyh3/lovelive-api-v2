It's not like I care...
But how many times have I stood in front of the mirror?
Try it on, take it off
It's like an endless
Pile of stuff on my bed, I swear
Tell me what's your fave baby?
Before I knew it, it was only you
I can't hide it anymore, I can't lie
The time that's piling up and the ideas
That are overflowing are all proof
Baby, You're my wonder!
My heart is bouncing and it won't stop
Up and down and dancing
Up and down and dancing
Wonder!
Yes, the secret dress code is
Up and down and dancing
You better not miss this sign

Check it out, Check it out
Digi dandan dindi dan to anywhere

I picked this and delivered it to you with a twist
In the shop window, check out this silhouette
Then deep breath, deep breath
Hope you like it
Don't miss out on this season's trends
Show me the style now, baby
It feels like
Maybe something's about to being, feel the vibe
The closer I get, the more it fades away
The city's noise along with it
Baby, You're my wonder
My heart is jumping and it won't stop
Up and down and dancing
Up and down and dancing
Wonder!
Yes, the dress code for the showdown is
Up and down and dancing
I want to catch your heart
I'm so overwhelmed I can't even think of a strategy
Up and down...
Can you hear this?
Baby, You're my wonder!
My heart is bouncing and it won't stop
Up and down and dancing
Up and down and dancing
Wonder!
Yes, the secret dress code is
Up and down and dancing
