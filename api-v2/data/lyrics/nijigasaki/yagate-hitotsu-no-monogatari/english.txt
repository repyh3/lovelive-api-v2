I still can't come up with an answer
And I won't say it'll be easy
I wonder if I can express
These feelings through my lines
But only when I'm with you
That these words come to me like its second nature
When I'm lost in the darkness you're my light
A light of resolution
So then, lead the way for me
Let's come together, and of these stories make yours and mine
Finally, a single one
Let's make of what's called life, our greatest stage
And shine down on it
Surely, if I'm with you
Any ending can become a happy ending
In order to get together in the end
It's necessary for us to star apart
Let's try to make this a masterpiece
In which two different stories get mixed in
The time I met you I realized for the first time
I was feeling negatively about myself
"You should try out acting
It feels like it suits you best"
You were the one who told me that
Let's walk together towards the line that begins this phrase
Marking itself as a new third chapter
Collecting all foreshadowing we've seen before
To a satisfying climax
Surely when I'm done expressing all my feelings for you
It would be curtain call for both of us
I won't ever hesitate again
The feelings I have now told me that
If you are by my side
I know I will get stronger
Let's come together, and of these stories make yours and mine
Finally, a single one
Let's make of what's called life, our greatest stage
And shine down on it
Surely, if I'm with you
Any ending can become a happy ending
