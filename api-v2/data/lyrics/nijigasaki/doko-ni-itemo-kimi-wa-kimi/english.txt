Wherever you are, you are you
You always focus on what you like
That's so typical of you
But something is changing.
Ah, guided by a premonition, my heart stirs
From now on, when an
Unknown sky calls us
What should we do? Yeah, you know, don't you?
"I want to dive into the adventure," you say
What kind of dreams will be born tomorrow? (I'm a dreamer like you)
It's fun, exciting, and sometimes nostalgic
My desire to follow you grows more and more
Today I could give my best too, I did it!
Take a good rest and relax, so you'll be filled with energy
See you soon, see you soon!
Even when you pause, you are still you
So, take a short break for whatever comes next
Something else will change
Ah, don't be afraid, let's ride a different wind
Let's keep challenging ourselves from now on
This experience is a treasure
What do we want to do? Yes... we already know!
"I want to have as much fun as possible," you say
What kind of dreams did you have yesterday? (I'm a dreamer too)
You come closer, move away, and try again
Your courage will always be my inspiration
If we face today with curiosity and fun,
Anything can happen, things will work out somehow.
When our eyes meet, we laugh, we laugh!
Yes, without realizing it, everything changes (silently)
In the middle of a new scenery (everything changes)
Ah, we're heading towards a new dream
Both you and I, with so many emotions
We collide in different places, reaffirming ourselves
What kind of dreams will be born tomorrow? (I'm a dreamer like you)
It's fun, exciting, and sometimes nostalgic
My desire to follow you grows more and more
Today I could give my best too, I did it!
Take a good rest and relax, so you'll be filled with energy
See you soon, see you soon!
Wherever we are, you are you, and I am me
See you soon, see you soon!
