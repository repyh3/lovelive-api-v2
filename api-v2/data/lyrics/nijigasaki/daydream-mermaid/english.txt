Oh, we can get there! Chase after it
Floating in my dreams!
Deep, deep in my heart,
It seems my curiosity had been asleep
The waves shake me, and I wake up
Like jewels, the bubbles
Are bursting
Shapes and colors of all kinds
Appear one after another
Oh my! Oh my!
How captivating!
Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe...
I want to make each one of them come true
If I slowly open my eyes, what's always beside me is
The vibrant warmth of colors
And I feel like I can do anything. Yes, I feel it!
Oh, we can get there! Chase after it
Dive into the future you've chosen
Cannot pick up one! In those moments,
It's alright to be greedy
Let's swim and dance like a mermaid
While following the excitement that calls us
Oh, we can be brave! Chase after it
Let's swim freely in the sea of dreams
Will do! All the things!
Floating in my dreams!
I can't wait for tomorrow anymore
Every day, I get closer to the dreams that keep growing
The light reflects on the surface of the water
Shining brightly
Like jewel dust
Let's ride the incoming waves,
And say hi to our true desires!
I'm fine! Feel fine!
Be honest with yourself
In the world of consciousness, without gravity,
Nothing is impossible
Surely, the door opened for the first time when I searched for it
Dreaming, drawing, wishing... that was
The first step. Now I believe it!
Any way we go! Let's go with a smile
Catch the future you want to reach
There is more than one! Not just only one!
Even some detours are alright
Looking up at the sky on a sunny day,
Listening to the rain fall
The unexpected and the unforeseen,
I enjoy it! No matter how
Even if the wind (stops me)
Or I get lost (I'll be okay)
One by one,
A bright trace of dreams
With the most authentic expression of who I am now,
I'll leave my mark in this extraordinary present day
Do it! Take it! More! At any moment,
Let's draw the ideal future
There is more than one! No one can
Stop this excitement,
Right?
Oh, we can get there! Chase after it
Dive into the future you've chosen
Cannot pick up one! In those moments,
It's alright to be greedy
Let's swim and dance like a mermaid
While following the excitement that calls us
Oh, we can be brave! Chase after it
Let's swim freely in the sea of dreams
Will do! All the things!
Floating in my dreams!
