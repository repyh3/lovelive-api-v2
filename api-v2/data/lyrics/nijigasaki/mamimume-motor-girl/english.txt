Keep going! Overtake! Dodge it! Reach it!
I'm shifting into a higher gear - let's get started again today!!!!
(Don't you worry, Don't you worry baby!)
(Whoa!)
My heart's all over the place, rolling around but
I'm movin' on (movin' on)
I want to overcome even the most ridiculous regulations, let's run!
(It's fate, we are friends forever!)
Ma-cha Mi-cha
Mu-cha Me-cha - Motor Girl
Run, run, knocking on the future
Da Ba ShaBaDaVa Let's go!
Ma-ma-ma-mi-mu-me-mo!
Just a click to launch it, and you'll be online (notifications turned ON)
How far can I go with you, even though I can't meet you?
Our hearts beat faster as we synchronize our breathing
It's almost magical - it feels like you're right here, laughing with me
(But that is what's good about it!)
Red, white, and green (mixing together)
Spinning round and round (my eyes, my eyes!)
No matter what tier we're at, it all depends on how well we cooperate
We'll get hooked! (Let's go!)
We'll get lost! (To Win!)
It's a small world (whoa!)
My heart's all over the place, rolling around but I'm movin' on (movin' on)
We're dashing ahead, aiming to become legends - look at us go!
(Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!)
Fly ahead! Overtake! We'll seize the goal as a team (whoa!)
Being shoved around in a jumble, and pushing back
That's right, run this distance that's getting closer!
(It's fate, we are friends forever!)

(Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!)
(Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!)
I'm not too good at strategy,
Because everything is still so new to me
If you stay connected and keep learning,
The rankings will follow you
Order, emotion, girl, structure -
Rising up on the network is going really well
I'm a racer, time chaser
I'll pick up the pace and the rotation
Even if it's a 1-2 finish (and then?)
It has to be with you (no, no, no, no)
The laughter of my usual friends
Is the trophy that moves me
(Whoa!)
My heart's all over the place, rolling around but I'm movin' on (movin' on)
We're dashing ahead, aiming to become legends - look at us go!
(Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!)
Fly ahead! Overtake! We'll seize the goal as a team (whoa!)
Being shoved around in a jumble, and pushing back
That's right, run this distance that's getting closer!
(It's fate, we are friends forever!)
