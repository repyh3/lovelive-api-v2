We shine like the stars in the sky
Our power surges like the sun
In all of nature swirling around
You'll never find two planets like us
For us to be born here was destiny (we were led here)
Darkness and light, shine so sinfully bright
Now, when they become one
Future! We'll show you the best
Future! Won't you give your body over to the beat?
Future! Wish! More! Freedom!
Can't look at it anymore? Baby
Oh... Let's run, we can fly!
Future! Wish! More! Freedom!
Shine, super nova, to the ends of the galaxy! Let's go!
Once we start moving we can't be stopped
We're at the speed of light, this satellite
We'll mind-jack the world
Lighting up your sinking feelings
Slipping into your heart, this Diver
Once I've caught you there's no going back
This is utopia
They'll talk about us to eternity, our memory (carved up)
We'll fly past the atmosphere
Now it's time to blast off
Future! Come, let's stand on that faraway stage
Future! Won't you put this melody to mouth?
Future! Wish! More! Freedom!
Can't control it anymore? Baby
Oh... Wanna see? It's a brand new world!
Future! Wish! More! Freedom!
Believe it! super future
Emotions we've never felt
Fill us, melt our thoughts away
I'm sure you've felt it
Catch it
Don't let go
Now, jump high! Dive!
Back to back
The two lights
Mix, awake their chemistry
The whole world is waiting
Let's begin the revolution
Future! Let's all create a miracle
Future! Shout out whatever dream you want
Future! We'll show you the best
Future! Won't you give your body over to the beat?
Future! Wish! More! Freedom!
Can't control it anymore? Baby
Oh... Let's run, we can fly!
Future! Wish! More! Freedom!
Shine, DiverDiva, to the ends of the galaxy! Let's go!
