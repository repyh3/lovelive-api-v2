(Hey! Hey! It's my turn!)
If we don't talk, we'll always be strangers
If we don't talk, we'd be wasting a great chance
Tell me more about yourself
Tell me the food you like and tell me your type
I love it when you're laughing and I don't mind you when you're mad
But if I had to choose, a smile is better
So I'll try joking around next to you
I'll always, always stay near you, ok?
Never, never let go of me (together!)
Wherever we are, GO!
That's right, You & I, it's always You & I
Together You & I, are quite dangerous You & I
In other words, that's love, love, love
Everyone is my friend, my friend, my friend
Because I love you, I'll always stand by you
I need you quite a lot, so why don't you stand by me
Say!! Love, love, love
Come on!! Friendship, friendship, friendship
My BFF's!
When we chat, it's a ton of fun
I had no idea that you were a jokester
What a discovery of the century
People really shouldn't judge a book by its cover
I swear I'll definitely pay more attention now
I'll find 100 more good things about you
Because You & I will last forever You & I
Today is You & I, even tomorrow is You & I
That's love, love, love
Let's relax and be friends, friends, friends
That's why I promise to stand by you
And you can stand by me anytime
Everybody say!! Love, love, love
Come on!! Friendship, friendship, friendship
My BFF's!
I can't help but want to hold your hand
We have a bond that'll make anyone jealous
That's right, You & I, it's always You & I
Together You & I, are quite dangerous You & I
In other words, that's love, love, love
Everyone is my friend, my friend, my friend
Because I love you, I'll always stand by you
I need you quite a lot, so why don't you stand by me
Say!! Love, love, love
Come on!! Friendship, friendship, friendship
Because You & I will last forever You & I
Today is You & I, even tomorrow is You & I
That's love, love, love
Let's relax and be friends, friends, friends
That's why I promise to stand by you
And you can stand by me anytime
Everybody say!! Love, love, love
Come on!! Friendship, friendship, friendship
My BFF's!
