When I say, "I'm home", and I switch on the light
I can see your breathing, so light and free
Gazing at the flickering stove,
My heart feels all warm and fuzzy
In this dreamlike moment, the signal sounds for us to start
Stacking up the books I've yet to finish
Which story should I continue next?
Have a bowl of warm soup, I hope you enjoy it
Ah, let's get cozy and warm
Tomorrow should be even more wonderful than today
There's so much I want to do...
I can't help but say, "I'm excited!"
Round and round, if I wrap us up all warm and snug
And listen to this song, together, we'll reach our dreams...
Close your eyes and drift away
When I say, "good night", and turn off the light
The stars begin to smile at me from outside the window
The powdery snow dances around,
The soft moonlight shines, sparkling so bright
I just want to gaze at it a little longer
Will I ever reach the final page?
Epilogue, Ah...
Tomorrow fades, as time flows by, becoming yesterday
I don't want to have regrets
I want to fulfill all my dreams
Round and round, if I wrap myself in all this warmth
Then I can softly hum a tune, slowly drifting into a dream...
Close your eyes and drift away
I wonder, are you spending
A similar night as well?
You must drift off to sleep before the sun wakes
Hurry up, go to sleep and good night
In this small room, something's spreading around
It's a warm happiness
That comes with a pure and simple life
Tomorrow should be even more wonderful than today
There's so much I want to do...
I can't help but say, "I'm excited!"
Round and round, if I wrap us up all warm and snug
And listen to this song, together, we'll reach our dreams...
Close your eyes and drift away
