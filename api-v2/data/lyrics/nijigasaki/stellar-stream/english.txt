Even if you're alone, you're not alone
My heart is always by your side
Believing in an unknown tomorrow
We soar across the sky, high
In the clear sky, one after another
The shining stars begin to run
What do you wish for? Where are you going?
Hey, tell me
Surpassing the me of yesterday
At the end of my extended hand,
My steady heartbeat resounds
I move forward without hesitation
We'll meet again in that future we wove together
Rise up and we shout
We're gliding above
Higher than we've ever imagined
To reach those gazes that grow more intense
With all our might, with all our might
We move through the sky of infinite dreams
Wrapped in dazzling light
We flutter through wherever
When I think of the future, my destiny blooms,
And my heart beats stronger
Even if the path towards that destiny
Drifts away from me...
In this vast and great universe,
I gather hope with all my strength
We unite our hearts with dreams upon dreams
I'll embrace them always, holding them tight
So that tomorrow, too,
You may have a smile on your face
Fill up with the dreams
Like stellars above
Even more passionately than the first step of the day
As we extend our stories, they'll shine even brighter
We'll surely meet again
We will smile in the sky of infinite dreams
Believing in an unknown tomorrow
We soar across the sky, high
Blooming more times than I can count
An overflowing "thank you"
Fills my heart
The promises I want to cherish are
Gaining color and sparkling
I won't hesitate anymore
I'm going to fulfill my wishes right now
Rise up and we shout
We're gliding above
Higher than we've ever imagined
To reach those gazes that grow more intense
With all our might, with all our might
We move through the sky of infinite dreams
Wrapped in dazzling light
We flutter through wherever
