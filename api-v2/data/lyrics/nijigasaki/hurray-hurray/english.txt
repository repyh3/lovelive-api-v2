Woh oh oh we'll send it Woh oh oh to the future…
At the start of the day the classroom is illuminated
By the light filtering through the trees
There’s a gleam (gleaming),
The doodles on the desk smile up at us
By having someone always next to me
Who makes me laugh,
I was taught that
These moments are truly irreplaceable
Because of how dazzling every day is
I get a bit uneasy (but even so)
More than that, I'm so happy,
I could cry!
I want to convey this "Hurray, hurray"!
Let's enjoy ourselves! Alright?
If we supported each other,
(If it's you, if it's us)
We'll overcome our struggles, so just believe!
The near future is definitely not going to change
Our friendship will always be there
Being the closest to each other really is wonderful!
Let's go towards what awaits
Just like this
Running straight ahead!
Woh oh oh we'll send it Woh oh oh to the future...
The after-school bell rings
Signaling the start of our daily routine: "where should we go?"
There's a gentle (gentle)
Scent of a fresh breeze
I want to be with you just a bit longer
So we take all sorts of detours
But there's meaning in the most trivial things
At least, that what I think
Someday, will we go
Our separate ways? (But even so)
I can't imagine
Being happier than we are in this moment!
I want to convey this "Hurray, hurray"!
Let's enjoy ourselves! Alright?
With these overlapping voices
(If it's you, if it's us)
We'll send a shout to the heavens, and a high five to the sky!!
The near future is definitely not going to change
Our wishes are under the same sky,
Wherever we go, connected by this song
While aiming towards a shining tomorrow
Let's run straight ahead!
I love this
There really is a thing such as fate!
Because it's you, I can think that I'm glad to have met you
Even after many years have passed, I want to cherish these feelings
Nobody can (erase them)
These magic words
The near future is definitely not going to change
We'll gather outside the window in the schoolyard
And seize our youth!
I want to convey this "Hurray, hurray"!
Let's enjoy ourselves! Alright?
If we supported each other,
(If it's you, if it's us) We'll overcome our struggles, so just believe!
The near future is definitely not going to change
Our friendship will always be there
Being the closest to each other really is wonderful!
Let's go towards what awaits
Just like this
Running straight ahead!
Woh oh oh we'll send it Woh oh oh to the future...
