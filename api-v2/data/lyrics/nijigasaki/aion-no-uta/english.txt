If you want to cry the tears you held back
It'd be okay to cry so many you could drown in them
If someday, this day comes back to mind
It'd be nice if you could be kind to someone
This shining love from over a thousand years
Is embedded with a thousand mile's worth of feelings
That's why, whenever you feel dreary,
I'll play this song and envelop you in it
So that this warmth will reach you, I'll sing to you
Closer to your side than anyone else
On the moonlit nights you spend alone
You can come here, just as you asked
The miracle of finding a cast-off cicada shell, empty of anything,
Is tightly connected to embraces, full of compassion
That's why, like the bright, cheerful sun,
I'll show you a dream
So that I can give this warmth to you
I'll sing to that heart of yours
If by any chance, your heart feels
Healed by this song
Then, similarly, I hope that you can
Someday guide somebody else through their pain
Whenever you feel dreary,
I'll play this song and envelop you in it
So that this warmth will reach you
I'll stay closer to your side than anyone else, ah...
Like the bright, cheerful sun,
I'll show you a dream
So that I can give this warmth to you
I'll sing to that heart of yours
