I want to go see you now
Dancing on the breeze
I'm heading your way
So wait for me
(La la la... La la la...)
Flying over the crystal-clear sky
Gently, softly, surely to you
Catch me and hold my true love
No matter how far away
No matter where you are
Blooming
Find me and keep my true heart
A heart warmed in the blink of an eye
Toward the voice calling I'll be there
Counting down the dazzling dawn
Catching the wind, I'll be there
Catch me anywhere
Find me everywhere
Sunny skies turn to rain
Rain gives way to rainbows
Shooting stars
How many have I sent off?
(La la la... La la la...)
Watching the sky's ever-changing hues
Gently, softly, in the palm of my hand
Touch me and feel my pure spark
Even apart, stronger
So it reaches you, even more
Blooming
Reach for me, and show your true spark
We'll meet again beyond the blink, so
Toward the light Here we stand
If ever you look down
Search for me
Yes, from town to town
Let me bloom beside you Forever
Your figure running toward tomorrow
I'll always look up to you
Catch me and hold my true love
No matter how far
No matter where
Blooming
Find me and keep my true heart
A heart warmed within a blink
Toward the voice calling I'll be there
Counting down the dazzling dawn
Catching the wind I'll be there
Catch me anywhere
Find me Everywhere
