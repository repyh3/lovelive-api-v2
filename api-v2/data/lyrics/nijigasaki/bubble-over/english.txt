Who is that boy?! Who are you?
ZZZT! The moment I saw you, that happened in a flash
Who is that boy?! Who are you?
This library of love appears every Wednesday and Thursday
Oh, jesus!
Hot eyes peek through the cracks in a bookshelf
There are other hunters lurking around, so watch out
At the very back, there's a special seat
Wow wow wow by the window
Hey! Out of my way, it's my turn to be sitting there
Hey! My heart becomes so full
Everytime I lay my eyes on you
The thrill is bubbling over
Baby I wanna wanna wanna wanna get next to you
Don't look at anybody else
I gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta talk to you
Oh my god, when you get too close,
I can't breathe, how can I get along?!
The thrill is bubbling over
Baby I wanna wanna wanna wanna get next to you
Who is that boy?! Who are you?
ZZZT! Is this what they call love at first sight?
Who is that boy?! Who are you?
I ignore my assignments to read a manual about love
Let's see..
According to the book, it's all about the eyes
Just tilt your face ever so slightly and smile?!
I don't think I can do this, it's so hard
Wow wow wow what should I do?
Hey! Turn around baby; please god
Hey! Make my love come true
I have a crush on you
My heartbeat is bubbling over
Baby I wanna wanna wanna wanna spend time with you
I can't believe someone took you away
No! No! No! I gotta gotta appeal to you
The countdown is getting closer
Are you not interested in me? How can I make u mine?!
My heartbeat is bubbling over
Baby I wanna wanna wanna wanna spend time with you
I wanna.. Baby I gotta..
No matter what I do, I can't get u out of my mind
I love you, baby
Ah, First time in my life
My whole body is so hot!

The thrill is bubbling over
Baby I wanna wanna wanna wanna get next to you
Don't look at anybody else
