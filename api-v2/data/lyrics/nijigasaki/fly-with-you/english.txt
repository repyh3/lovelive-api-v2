Having looked at the sky, in which the rainbow stretched,
I closed my eyes from the blinding light
And when I opened them again,
A bright world surrounded me
Even on those days, when I felt like just a little longer and I would give up,
That support and those smiles
Gave me energy, thanks for them
It's like magic, isn't it?
Days go round and round
But each of them is different somehow
Because no matter the weather period
I can think: "everything will be okay"
Let's fly to the best! The best smile!
Let’s go even beyond the best
We can fly
To the other side of the sky that no one knows about yet
Dreaming, smiling, I'm chasing like crazy
My engine is at full power
When I'm with you, I can go anywhere
Let's hold hands
And go anywhere together
The sky is full of clouds so thick
That I can't see what’s ahead
I spread my wings
The cheers echo in my chest
Holding them tightly,
I will now go towards the light of tomorrow
Illuminated by the sunlight
Shrouded in the starry sky
There is a rainbow of continuous dreams
There is excitement that never ends
The best love! The best live!
Let's go even beyond the best
This thrilling story
The trajectory of our radiance, their continuation
Let's draw it, smiling, track it and convey it
The feelings that overwhelm me,
I will convey them to you again and again
Let's unite our hearts
Forever and ever!
Love is... your life
Love is... my life
Love is... always overlapping
Always with love, forever and ever...
Let's fly to the best! The best smile!
Let’s go even beyond the best
When we break through even the cloudy sky,
Smiling, smiling, we will continue to move on
Beyond the days gone by
Indulging in new dreams
Let's smile at each other again
Let's hold hands tightly again!
The best love! The best live!
Let's go even beyond the best
This thrilling story
The trajectory of our radiance, their continuation
Let's draw it, smiling, track it and convey it
The feelings that overwhelm me,
I will convey them to you again and again
Let's unite our hearts
Forever and ever!
I'm going to accept love
I'm going to convey love
Now to you
(Sing)
Let's live, by accepting love
Let's live, by conveying on love
Ah, I'm next to you!
