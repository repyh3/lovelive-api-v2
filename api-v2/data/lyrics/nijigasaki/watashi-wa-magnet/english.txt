Although we were supposed to be in the same room,
It was divided into two parts by a glass borderline
But you pulled me out of it with your own hands
By showing that there was no password.
Ah, what should I do?
In such a world everything is completely new to me
All that remains is for me to just accept it
Next time I want to give this a smile
I love you!
Tens, hundreds of times along with my songs
I want to support you, whom I love so much and value so much
My heart is filled with them, it can no longer be stopped
I'm a magnet, I'm stuck to you and will never come off
Woh woh... I love you! This is forever!
Woh woh... I love you! This is forever!
Tears are welling up in my eyes from emotions, I'm in a panic, awawa
I want to do something about it... the pain, go away
What I can do for someone
Is simply unimaginable for the old me
And for the current me
This is something wonderful and amazing
I love you!
Tens, hundreds of times will not be enough,
I want to give you my love and gratitude
My heart is filled with them, it can no longer be stopped
I'm a magnet, I'm stuck to you and will never come off
Although I can't express it properly in words,
You are special to me,
Because, as soon as you experience such feelings,
I'll want to save even more in my archive
Tens, hundreds of times along with my songs
I want to support you, whom I love so much and value so much
My heart is filled with them, it can no longer be stopped
I'm a magnet, I'm stuck to you and will never come off
Woh woh... I love you! This is forever!
Woh woh... I love you! This is forever!
