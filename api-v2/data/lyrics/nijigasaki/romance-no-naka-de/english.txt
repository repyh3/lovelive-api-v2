Projected on the big screen was a love story
I was mesmerized
When I looked around, I found myself in another world
It's like I wandered into a fairytale world
It's a thrilling encounter with the unknown
Time moves on around me
If I was the protagonist,
Could I rewrite it so these tears were tears of happiness?
When the end-credits appear,
I'll probably be transported back to the real world
But if I were to open up the door to that room,
I'll always be able to see you
It's like I'm being guided down this path
My heart pounded with anticipation of what was to happen next
At the time, I had not idea that
A story like this was waiting for me
We look up at the same light
I want to stay like this for just a little longer
If I was the protagonist,
I'd want to walk through this scenery with you
Even when the end-credits appear,
I'll never forget this miraculous moment
Yes, even if this was a fantasy,
The excitement I felt was real
If I feel sad, I just have to think of
The miracles that occurred here to smile again
If I was the protagonist,
Could I rewrite it so these tears were tears of happiness?
When the end-credits appear,
I'll probably be transported back to the real world
But if I were to open up the door to that room,
I'll always be able to see you
I'll come back here again someday
