Hey C'mon
I've been thinking about you
This time with you will never end
Laughter can be heard beyond the high blue sky (I like that!)
The windy pattern in the sky feels like an eternity (Baby C'mon)
I scroll through my memories (which one?) with my fingertips
I want to talk about (what?) our next plans again in the sunset
When I noticed time had gone by, I became sad
These overlapping memories can't fit within a square frame, Oh!
I'll gather up all of these treasures and write them down
The future is still calling for us; I'm singing
Fly into the sky; swimming through the seasons
I'm striving to be the very best right now
I can't stop it
Fly into the time; I'm feeling excited
Drawing a pure emotion that is so beautiful
I want to fill tomorrow with light
From now on, I'm here with you
In moments that don't disappear, true feelings have been piling up (yeah!)
Our times together have become the norm (One more time)
Yesterday (and always), I sent you a message after we parted ways
These uninterrupted words (are always) overflowing in the sunrise
We always end up talking about silly things
Our feelings have the urge to feel the same way, Oh!
Everything will be more fun when I'm with you
No matter what color the future shines in
Fly into the sky; call out to the seasons
Let's find the very best thing right now
Don't stop me
Fly into the time; our hearts resonate
The sensitivity of emotions is colored positively
Days like this are so exciting
From now on, I'll always be with you
I can't stop this excitement
I'm always looking forward to seeing you
Bold dreams are quite good too
It's okay to be the strongest today
Everything is like a festival with you
With a new face everyday, let's keep laughing
Fly into the sky; swimming through the seasons
I'm striving to be the very best right now
I can't stop it
Fly into the time; I'm feeling excited
Drawing a pure emotion that is so beautiful
I want to fill tomorrow with light
From now on, I'm here with you
