I want to remain as I am
I want you to be yourself
I don't want you and me
To change because of my mistakes
And I don't want to tie you down
I want you to live your life
I don't want you and me
To fade because of my mistakes
I'm not trying to say it's selfish
But if I'm allowed one thing,
Keep it close to your heart
Just yours and my secret
For example, the fact that I left on you the connecting us mark,
Or the way you wrap your arms around my neck with a smile, La La La
Let's spend our days, without telling anyone about this
(We're×connected!)
Even when we're not together, you glance at the connecting us mark,
And when you see me again, you smile with your eyes, as if to say: "it's a secret"
After all this alone already makes me happy
I don't want to act carefully
And I'm not going to force myself on you
I don't like the idea that "because I'm your lover, I can do whatever I want"
I'm not going to become a burden to you
But if I'm allowed one thing,
Watch carefully, so that it doesn't disappear,
Just yours and my secret
Fill every empty day with your smiles
Tracing the faint connecting us mark that remains, La La La
Let's spend our days, without anyone knowing about it
(We're×connected!)
What connecting us mark will I leave next time on top of the old one?
Will it reaffirm my feelings, as if to say: "I love you"?
Just the thought of it makes me grin
Something more noticeable than the red thread of fate,
In which I can believe,
Apart from this I don't need anything else
What a happy person I am,
Since you make me feel this way?
You know, thank you
You feel the same, don't you?
If you're not too self-centered, let me prove it, wow
For example, the fact that I left on you the connecting us mark,
Or the way you wrap your arms around my neck with a smile, La La La
Let's spend our days, without telling anyone about this
(We're×connected!)
Even when we're not together, you glance at the connecting us mark,
And when you see me again, you smile with your eyes, as if to say: "it's a secret"
After all this alone already makes me happy
I want to put into words that I'm happy
La La La
