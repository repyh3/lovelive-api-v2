Feel my heartbeat, yeah
My eyes met with you many times
You find we begin to align
Dramatic story of our love's started
Alright... Oh, yeah
We know that you are so bright
I've heard they think you're so fine
I know you deeper
And I can make you smile
Hey, the truth is I'm losing sleep
I'm wondering if you'll be mine... Or not...
Never want you seeking someone
For I'll be the one you'll find
Feel my heartbeat
"You're my love, you're my love"
Can't stop this feeling
"You're my love, you're my love"
I can't contain it
Seen through my eyes
You make me so high
Our love is like lemonade, I keep on tasting
"You're my love, you're my love"
The words don't capture
"You're my love, you're my love"
First it's happened
How about we try
And let this love fly
Nobody does it but you throughout this planet
La la la, la la la... Moving near you
La la la, la la la... Feel me, darling
La la la, la la la... You excite me
La la la, la la la... A brand new feeling
Can't find nobody like you
Throughout the vast universe
Two separate stories
Combined with love divine
Hey, if I were to open up
Will something corrupt with us? Or not...
This story is fast and abrupt
First love's full of ups and downs
Feel your heartbeat
"You're my love, you're my love"
We're moving closer
"You're my love, you're my love"
My heat is rising
I don't know why
But you're on my mind
I'm never letting myself ignore this feeling
"You're my love, you're my love"
With perfect timing
"You're my love, you're my love"
I'll make my move and
As sun will rise
Way up in the sky
I wanna keep on adding more pages to this
Nobody knows the ending to this romance
I'm wishing this goes right, asking all day in my mind
Even our conversations, plain at a glance
Take a spot in my heart, and I
Keep remembering
"You're my love, you're my love"
"You're my love, you're my love"
When you're by my side
I lose track of time
Please don't overlook my sign
So, take my hand and come with me now
"You're my love, you're my love"
Can't stop this feeling
"You're my love, you're my love"
I can't contain it
Seen through my eyes
You make me so high
Our love is like lemonade, I keep on tasting
La la la, la la la... Moving near you
La la la, la la la... Feel me, darling
La la la, la la la... You excite me
La la la, la la la... A brand new feeling
La la la, la la la... Moving near you
La la la, la la la... See me, darling
La la la, la la la... Wanna feel special
La la la, la la la... A brand new feeling
