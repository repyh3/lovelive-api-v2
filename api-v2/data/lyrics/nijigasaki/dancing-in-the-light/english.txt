Feelin' high
The special night...Let's Go！
Shining bright
Feelin' high
The special night
Look, light me up
You have an honest and serious personality
For example, you're like the main character of a TV show
I've sent messages to grab your attention, but it's not working
What should I do now?
Your castle that only exists during the night
Because you're so kind, I'll let you protect me as I sleep
Slowly but surely, I slip into a deep slumber
Opening the door to where my prince is
In my dream, we're embraced by a warm light
The light spreads around the world
Illuminating the night
The whole world starts to dance
The light embraces the neighbourhood
The orchestra reaches the climax
Don't let this end, don't wake me up
Forever and ever...just kidding!
Feelin' high
The special night...Let's Go！
Shining bright
Feelin' high
The special night
Look, light me up
Your message is "what are you doing right now?"
My heart is about to jump out of my chest
To calm myself down, I'll have a cup of tea
As I think about my response
Writing then erasing, writing then erasing; an endless cycle
I'm not sure how to respond
The castle's gates have been closed for so long
I don't know if I'll be able to see you again
In my heart, we care about each other
Connected by the thread of fate
When I turned around, I saw it
That gentle look in your eyes
We're in love with each other
No more words need to be spoken
I've known this since way back when
This feeling...it has to be right!
In my dream, it's suddenly our future
In the highest tower, we cuddle up to each other
When we gaze up at the starry sky,
We'll hold each other close (What! No way!)
We're embraced by a warm light
The light spreads around the world
Illuminating the night
The whole world starts to dance
The light embraces the neighbourhood
The orchestra reaches the climax
Don't let this end, don't wake me up
Forever and ever...we'll be together!
Feelin' high
The special night...Let's Go！
Shining bright
Feelin' high
The special night
Look, light me up
