After it rains, all sorts of colors
Come together on this path
I am who I am, so can I really change?
I can't take a leap of faith, nor can I be honest.
If I keep feeling this way,
Will I keep lying about the things I love?
I want to be more honest, and stop hiding my inner thoughts
On that day, I was still weak and cried easily
But by growing a little bit, I could say bye-bye to that cowardice
I'll unleash it - right here, right now.
I'll send it to you, EMOTION
After it rains, all sorts of flowers
Are in full bloom
I want to shine brighter than I do now
I used to look for reasons why I couldn't do things
But if I just went ahead and did them,
I'll come to love the things I enjoy
I want to be more honest, and stop hiding my inner thoughts
On that day, I was still weak and cried easily
But by growing a little bit, I could say bye-bye to that cowardice
I'll unleash it - right here, right now.
I'll send it to you, EMOTION
In the midst of every storm, I'll sing to you
I won't hold back anymore, I'll walk down the path I believe in.
I want to be more honest, and stop hiding my inner thoughts
On that day, I was still weak and cried easily
But by growing a little bit, I could say bye-bye to that cowardice
I'll unleash it - right here, right now.
I'll send it to you. I'll send it to you! EMOTION
