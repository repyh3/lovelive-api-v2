Come on! Emergency!
Melting away is my dream
Now the net is what I'm surfing
Stayed in all summer again this year
Say! Lonely
I caught AC sickness...
Totally wiped out. Can't even move
Gathering my courage in 1, 2, 3
The outside world is where I'm going
On my way to the next town over, all alone I'm walking
Floating in from somewhere, I can hear music
A sparkling ocean view
Just give me one sec to choose
While spinning round and round,
I'm on the verge of overheating
Suddenly, someone called out to me from out of nowhere
And gave me a fizzy carbonated soda
Without thinking, I look into the bubbles and dive
I'm in a pinch
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
To this magical beat, beat, beat
These fuzzy feelings... I want to figure them out
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
Let's enjoy this miracle while we're at it!
It's getting hotter and hotter, c'mon, heat up
Open your heart - be your true self
Click! Click! Unlock the lock!
Apparently, there's no such thing as being "wrong"
Apparently, it's okay to be free
To the dull version of me: Bye! Bye!
To the unfamiliar me: Hi! Hi!
Loading... Loading... Transforming (Yeah)
Just like this - get down
To the right, to the left, wherever I turn, it's a new flavor
Before I knew it, I was swaying and already taken a step forward
Without thinking, I look into the waves and dive
I'm in a pinch
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
To this magical beat, beat, beat
This feeling keeps growing... and I want to feel it for real
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
I might be in a bit of trouble
Growing hotter and hotter, c'mon, heat up
Up Up Up & Down
Closing our distance
I'm searching for the reason for this excitement
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
The flutter in my heart won't stop sending signs
I can hear it: beep, beep
Don't be afraid, oh summer days
A midsummer dream, swaying with the dancing waves
This heartbeat I can't hold back is
Because of this explosive beat, I can't control it
I don't know this feeling,
So tell me the midsummer code
In the middle of programming,
A secret memory resurfaces that I can't forget
On an adventure
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
To this magical beat, beat, beat
This sparkling feeling - I want to keep feeling it
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
Let's enjoy this miracle while we're at it!
It's getting hotter and hotter, c'mon, heat up
Up Up Up & Down
Closing our distance
I'm searching for the reason for this excitement
The signal goes beep, beep, beep
The flutter in my heart won't stop sending signs
Let me hear it: beep, beep
