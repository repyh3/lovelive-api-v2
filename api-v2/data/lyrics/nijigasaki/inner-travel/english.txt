I'm flying like a shooting star
Up in the sky
When I close my eyes, I feel it
The silence of the night and waves of sound
Spinning and circling for infinity,
Dancing freely in this inner world
I'm swimming through the fluffy clouds,
In a world that's mine alone
Spreading my arms as much as my heart desires,
To the sky on the journey of imagination
I'm flying like a shooting star
Up in the sky
There is no gravity
This world just floats free
There is no boundary
It's just infinity
Shine like a star
Forever
The sleeping city comes alive and begins to dance
I dance through the sky as much as I wish
I paint the colors of my dreams alone,
Much like the infinite sky
Letting my curiosity lead the way
I step into a brand-new world
I listen closely to the echoing melody
A midnight flight into a journey of dreams
I'm flying like a shooting star
Up in the sky
There is no gravity
This world just floats free
There is no boundary
It's just infinity
Shine like a star
Fly until the break of dawn
Up in the sky
Gliding afar
Shine like a star
Forever
