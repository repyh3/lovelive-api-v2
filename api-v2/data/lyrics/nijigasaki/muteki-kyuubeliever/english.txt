Woah woah, a mirror on the wall
Woah woah, come on and laugh with me
Woah woah, mirror on the wall
Believe in myself
Walking all by myself in middle of the night
Sighing again and again
The shiny bright illumination
Is so radiant, it reminds me of that girl
(Even if I try, will I never be able to catch up?)
No, I can't afford to feel down!
(Even I should be able to do this)
I'm easily the number one, after all!
There's only one me in this world -
I want to love myself more!
Hey girl in the mirror, beyond its surface
Let's show everyone the magic in our smile
Try beaming your best, brightest smile!
You can feel some confidence bubbling up, right?
Your face, keep it up!
I'm sweetie cutie braver
Woah woah, a mirror on the wall
Woah woah, come on and laugh with me
Woah woah, mirror on the wall
Believe in myself
When I realize it, I start over again
Feelings of being left behind is at its MAX
Waiting until the time is right all over again
You have times like that as well, right...?
"Tough rival will appear, and I will sweat"
"I wish you to see me doing my best"
"Its not going according to the plan"
Hey, bit by bit your eyes cant look away anymore, arent they?
Even if everyone in this world said "no"
I still want to believe in myself
Hey! Girl in the mirror!
Lets start with our best smile
I decided that I'm never going to feel down, never going to lose anymore
Lets blow away our worries
Look forward, I'm a Super Perfect Believer
Long night falls, and the morning rises
I'm sure I'm going to meet my new myself
I'm going to like my tomorrow self more
Than me today
Hey girl in the mirror, beyond its surface
Let's show everyone the magic in our smile
Try beaming your best, brightest smile!
I'm going to steal everyone's gazes on to myself
Hey! Girl in the mirror!
Lets start with our best smile
I decided that I'm never going to feel down, never going to lose anymore
Lets blow away our worries
Look forward I'm a Super Perfect Believer
Let's go! Invincible Believer
