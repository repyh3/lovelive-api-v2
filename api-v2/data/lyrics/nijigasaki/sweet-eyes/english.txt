My Love...
My Love...
Lovely Lovely Baby!
Throw back the curtains and say good morning!
The sunlight in my eyes is telling me "wake up"
Feeling the morning breeze, another bright and sunny day is waiting patiently
Same time as always its just you and me
Same place as always you walk by with your bright eyes...
I'm not sure how or why
But I look forward to these tiny glances all the time
"Ah... maybe it's just me? Uh... I can tell you soon
But I just don't know how to get it out"
Did I fall for you...!
Oh? I think I fell for you
Oh no, oh no...
Oh this is how it feels to be in love
Ah, I've fallen in love...? (oh I'm in love)
Admitting without a doubt I've caught these feelings
I've fallen in love...! (oh I'm in love)
Oh my god, it's plain as day
When I catch you looking my way
Floating together everyday
Never waking from this daze
I'll keep up, you just have to say the word
On cloud nine every day
Never ending glowing days
I want to know more about
Your sweet eyes!!
Gazing up at the sparkling starry night
The glowing moonlight is so bright...
Every time I feel the evening breeze, I think of you
"If only I could see you tomorrow"
I can't help but let out a sigh
If I'm being honest,
I've never felt like this before
Oh god, oh god...
I had no idea that love felt like this
Ah, I've fallen in love...!! (oh I'm in love)
These feelings are growing deep inside of me
I've fallen in love!! (oh I'm in love)
Oh my love, it's plain as day
It's taken control of me
My heart races every night
I'm always dreaming about you
If you want to see me, just say the word
On cloud nine every day
Never ending laughing days
I want to touch your sweet eyes more!!
Oh...
When the setting sun
Turns orange,
Your figure is reflected in my eyes
Ah, what do I do? My heart is racing
I feel so dizzy just seeing you
Oh! My Love...Heart!!
Ah, I've fallen in love...? (oh I'm in love)
Admitting without a doubt I've caught these feelings
I've fallen in love...! (oh I'm in love)
Oh my god, it's plain as day
When I catch you looking my way
Floating together everyday
Never waking from this daze
I'll keep up, you just have to say the word
On cloud nine every day
Never ending glowing days
I want to know more about
Your sweet eyes!!
Be My Be My Baby!!
