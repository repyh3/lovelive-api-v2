My dream came out of the classroom
I have to chase that with all my might
Sometimes we will stumble and fall
Let's laugh and talk about it later
The height of the sky depends on us
We have the freedom to change it
It's thanks to you that I noticed
I want to see more and more with my own eyes
Here we go!
Ah, I like it! I like it!
A colorful and bright kaleidoscope
This world is so beautiful and dazzling
I love it! I love it!
It is possible to extend it to infinity
I'll prove it to you
Wherever you are scream with all your might
Show me how you really are
Let's glitter! Don't stop!
The day I realized, each second
Has been carved into my memory
Every moment, even if ordinary
I will cherish them
There will be times when
My heart finds itself lost
Just remember! Remember your true feelings
You can grow to love yourself more and more
Here we go!
Ah, I like it! I like it!
A sound rings out again and again
Your smile is so beautiful and dazzling
I love it! I love it!
Even if some deny it
I'll always support you
Wherever you are scream with all your might
Show me how you really are
Let's glitter! Don't stop!
Time after time, my heart pounds
Those overflowing feelings aren't lies, are they?
They're not to me. They're not to anyone
We're the only ones who can paint our skies!
Ah, I like it! I like it!
A colorful and bright kaleidoscope
This world is so beautiful and dazzling
I love it! I love it!
It is possible to extend it to infinity
I'll prove it to you
Wherever you are scream with all your might
Show me how you really are
Let's glitter! Don't stop!
