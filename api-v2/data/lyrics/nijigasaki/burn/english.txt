Looking up at the sunlight, I start running; driven by desire
When I hear that resounding voice, my heart bounces even more, and we drive
Let me hear your heart - let's connect together
Dreams that I won't let stop
Keep going together
Ready to go?
"LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!"
A beat knocks on the door I was just about to shut
A rhythm that pushes off the ground, urging me to step forward
Then it surges up through my whole body
Setting my heart blazing even hotter
The doubts that I used to hold
Have turned into smiles that brighten my heart
Even a tiny wish can blaze brightly,
It's shining so vividly
We gotta burn!
C'mon, I'll take you anywhere
As I move forward on my way
These feelings that have begun must go on
Right now, let's shout them just as they are
The future I long for, the world I wish for
My hope is just like wings
It can fly all the way beyond those clouds
No matter how many times I wipe them away, my feelings keep overflowing
Set it ablaze - burning up!
I opened my half-opened eyes and looked up
The scenery dyed in deep crimson was so dazzling
I can hear that voice, it resonates in my heart
I can finally run forward
The ideals I've been envisioning all this time
Seem so far away the more I pursue them, but they drive me forward
Even if it lies forever out of reach, I'll still head towards it
Stretching out my hand
Break free, Burn!
C'mon, no matter how many times it takes
I'll stake everything on my way
In the midst of passion, time goes on
Let's shout at the top of our lungs now
The overlapping colors
And my heartbeat are a scarlet flame
Yes, I can go anywhere as long as it's with you
In this endlessly expanding universe where we met
Your smile, your melody,
The warmth of your cheering voice
None of it will ever fade away
I want to keep them close forever (We gotta burn!)
Break free, Burn!
C'mon, no matter how many times it takes
I'll stake everything on my way
In the midst of passion, time goes on
Let's shout at the top of our lungs now
The overlapping colors
And my heartbeat are a scarlet flame
Yes, I can go anywhere as long as it's with you
We gotta burn!
C'mon, I'll take you anywhere
As I move forward on my way
These feelings that have begun must go on
Right now, let's shout them just as they are
The future I long for, the world I wish for
My hope is just like wings
It can fly all the way beyond those clouds
No matter how many times I wipe them away, my feelings keep overflowing
Set it ablaze - burning up!
