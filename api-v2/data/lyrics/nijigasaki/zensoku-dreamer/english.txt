Hey, let's go
And fly out from here
The bright sun illuminates the street
And brings forth a brand new morning
Though the tears I shed yesterday dried up
My inside of my chest still aches a little
Even if a tall wall blocks the path
I want to seize it, realize my dream
And advance...!!
Full-speed dreamers!
Over it, over it, over it (up high)
I will soar, no matter where I have to go
My heart races as my dream comes to mind
Never give up! Dreamers!
Go forth, go forth, go forth (even further)
I'll jump over it as many times as I need to
It's especially when I'm lost that I'll put my faith in that
Strongly, strongly, strongly...!!
This baton of my dreams will connect me to it
I'll start all over again
As many times as I need to
Sometimes things don't go the way you planned
But someday they will, so it'll be okay
Because you gently supported me
I was able to cry and move on
Ah, the tightness is my chest is so painful
But it's shows how serious I am
Full-speed fighters!
To tomorrow, to tomorrow, to tomorrow (up high)
I'm on my way to do it all over again
The impulse overflows as my dream comes to mind
Never give up! Fighters!
Go forth, go forth, go forth (even further)
I'll get there as many times as I need to
Even when I want to stop, this feeling propels me forward
Every single time
This baton of courage will connect me to it
I'll keep running
As many times as I need to
Sighing as it rains all day
Feeling gloomy under this cloudy sky
But beyond those clouds
The weather is perfect at any time of the day
I am a dreamer!
Crying, crying, crying
I may appear weak
But c'mon, let's take that first step forward from here
Let's go! Dreamers!
Over it, over it, over it (up high)
I will soar, no matter where I have to go
My heart races as my dream comes to mind
Never give up! Dreamers!
Go forth, go forth, go forth (even further)
I'll jump over it as many times as I need to
It's especially when I'm lost that I'll put my faith in that
Strongly, strongly, strongly...!!
This baton of my dreams will connect me to it
I'll start all over again
As many times as I need to
