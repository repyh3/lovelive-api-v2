The sound coming from the kitchen drifts in
It's the same gentle morning as always
Seeing your wrinkled smile
And your hunched over back
"Don't watch TV while eating"
"Don't rest your elbows on the table"
Didn't I used to get told that a lot?
I don't get scolded for little things like that anymore
When I would come home late at night
You were there, waiting for me outside
Ah, sorry for making you worry about me
I want to be by your side tomorrow,
The day after, and beyond
The round, the round tender moon above
Seemed to glow brighter than ever tonight
Tu tu lu lu...
Just one more turn
And I'll be home
You kept saying "eat up, eat up"
And I was always stuffed
You gave me so much love
That it almost felt meddlesome
You make everything by hand,
And always dress them with floral patterns
The truth is, I want the trendy things
That everyone else hand, but I didn't say it
I'm sure there have been times
When I've been selfish and caused you trouble, right?
I wonder if someday...
Ah, I can become as gentle as you
I want to be by your side tomorrow,
The day after, and beyond, but...
The round, the round moon seems
About ready to hide behind the morning sun
I just love the sunrises and sunsets in this town
But someday, I'll have to turn my back on them
I want to tell you all about
The scenery I'm about to see
Just like what you once did for me
How long will I be able to be by your side?
Tomorrow, the day after, or beyond?
The round, the round tender moon above
Seemed to glow brighter than ever tonight
Tu tu lu lu...
Just one more turn
And I'll be home
