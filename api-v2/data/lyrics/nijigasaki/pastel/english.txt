The paintbrush with various colors intertwined will use its magical colors to
Paint tomorrow even more brilliantly
And the future with you are tightly intertwined
Overlook the colored streets as usual
The reflection of the sunset shimmers on the water
In this ordinary daily life, I don't know why but I suddenly feel happy today
After school, I naturally want to chat with you
Talk about the interesting things we've come across
I want to tell you about my secret dreams
The future drawn in the wish
Must be difficult to realize, but that's okay
Now look up at the canvas
That is waiting for us to paint it
I want to paint the gorgeous colors like a cocktail
Let the sky always be so bright
If we use that iridescent paint, we can change all kinds of worlds
The paintbrush with various colors intertwined will use its magical colors to
Paint tomorrow even more brilliantly
And the future with you are tightly intertwined
The breeze that blows and the happiness foretold by divination
How many steps must be taken to reach this longed-for view?
Thinking back to the episodes that haven't been told to you yet
Even the foolish yesterday
Or the days when we were ridiculed as weirdos
These tightly held hands
Give us a reason to stand up again
Instead of being afraid of what you know is wrong
Just keep looking ahead
Even if you'll regret it, I hope you can keep being yourself
How dazzling are the sweet days and glorious hours
Even if you stop under the rain clouds
They'll also always be by your side
The streets that are gradually dyed in color, please don't dissolve into the night
Although one day we will be separated
But with your color on me, I'll be stronger
Bring about miracles, now I have a definite hunch
I've always felt it
With this infinite rainbow of colors, we'll change whatever the world is
The paintbrush with various colors intertwined will use its magical colors to
Paint tomorrow even more brilliantly
And the future with you are tightly intertwined
