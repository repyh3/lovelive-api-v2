The words that everyone said that day
Are always in my heart
The future drawn in fragments of notes
So colorful, it's so beautiful
The way ahead will surely be tortuous and bumpy
Even when frustrated or feeling lost
But we'll surely be fine
Dreams will start to shine from now on
We'll always go forward on this road
Cause the light we believe in is shining on us
No fear of the torrential rain and the strong wind
We'll keep going under the sky
That day points to
I really miss the time I played with you
Wishes are folded into origami
After this, I'm surely everyone will go their separate ways
There will also be times when you're alone and hold back your tears
But no matter how many times, we'll surely meet again
After all, that's what you told me
Hearts that overlap and unite just like this
Even if we're separated, look, we'll still be connected somewhere
Your words and your smile
It hasn't faded since then
It has always been
In my heart
The scenery I have seen so far
Even if my heart begins to waver, it's still in my heart
All of this is not in vain,
Because we are connected
No matter what kind of road,
No matter where it leads,
We can go forward
We'll always go forward on this road
Cause the light we believe in is shining on us
No fear of the torrential rain and the strong wind
We'll keep going under the sky
That day points to
We'll keep going under the sky
That day points to
