The rhythm beaten out by the tea whisk
Brings me back into balance
Feelings change with the seasons,
A faint, faint aftertaste
When I listen closely in the silence,
I find that the world is gentler than I thought
The little birds are singing, swaying, softly
Blending into the breeze in harmony
The questions of my heart unravel
Not through calculations, but through a natural feel
I just want to live in this moment
Even as time drifts away, it remains here
Ah, this time, I'll never let it slip away again
Ai-ya, ai-ya, an undeniable light
Even if I'm confused, that's okay
Because I want to love everything I encounter
Ai-ya, ai-ya, the flowers, birds, wind, and moon
A faint bitterness
Wraps itself around me
A hidden taste that speaks of depth and
A sweet, sweet aftertaste
Even my restless heart is fulfilled
In this moment, as it returns
To the ever-turning cycle
Even as time drifts away, it remains here
Ah, when I truly look, I can hear its voice
Ai-ya, ai-ya, this undeniable life
Even if I don't have an answer, that's fine
I'll be myself until the day we meet
Ai-ya, ai-ya, the flowers, birds, wind, and moon
Yes, everything is beautiful
Even as time drifts away, it remains here
Ah, this time, I'll never let it slip away again
Ai-ya, ai-ya, an undeniable light
Even if I'm confused, that's okay
Because I want to love everything I encounter
Ai-ya, ai-ya, the flowers, birds, wind, and moon
