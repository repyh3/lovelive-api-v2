"Hey. It's me! Are you ready?"
Hotter, higher, faster than the speed of light
Your heart, I'll take it higher
Overwhelmingly stunning
You should definitely feel it, cuz why not?
I'll give you the excitement
Come on! It's show time!
Just seeming like the real deal (Uh-uh)
Isn't enough, so
Welcome to my world
Anyone can keep up with me? Anyone?
This view from my city of solitude
Is something that only I know!
That's how perfect I am, ah!
In a more addicted and intoxicated way
I'll shoot through it all, ooh I'm too good!!
I'm not afraid of anything, the time for games is over
This is where everything begins
Top of the top!
Top of the world!
Top of the top! (I AM THE BEST!)
The world revolves around me
Top of the top!
Top of the world!
Top of the top! (CUZ I AM THE BEST OF THE BEST!)
"Well, not bad, huh?"
These excited feelings are burning
You should definitely feel it, eye to eye
Will the excitement never stop?
Don't miss the best time!
It can only be me (Oh yeah)
Anything else isn't enough
My aura will attract the whole world
I'm the one who you've been waiting for
(You know that?)
I only want the best
It's all I've ever wished for!
That's how perfect I am, ah!
In a more majestic and enthusiastic way
I'll steal your gaze, ooh I'm too bad!!
I won't ever hestitate, I won't let anyone see my weaknesses
The world will expand from here to tomorrow
(I AM THE BEST!)
(CUZ I AM THE BEST OF THE BEST!)
If you put your hand on your chest, you'll find your true heart
(One, two, three, four... Again...)
The constant heartbeat
(One, two, three and four...)
Tells me the truth.
Hey, when those bias and assumptions
Get in the way, I won't close my eyes.
I'm not running away! I'll show you the best! Without a doubt.
Hotter, higher, faster than the speed of light
Your heart, I'll take it someplace higher
I won't ever hestitate, I won't let anyone see my weaknesses
Because history will be made here
Just follow me!
In a more addicted and intoxicated way
I'll shoot through it all, ooh I'm too good!!
I'm not afraid of anything, the time for games is over
This is where everything begins
Top of the top!
Top of the world!
Top of the top! (I AM THE BEST!)
The world revolves around me
Top of the top!
Top of the world!
Top of the top! (CUZ I AM THE BEST OF THE BEST!)
