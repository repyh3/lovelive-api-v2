Take off, I've been released from the boundaries of gravity
Gaia's light, we've finally arrived
"An unknown world floats within the darkness"
I'm now the moon walker of my dreams
This is the side where no light shines
If you take a closer look at the crater, so big! Incredible! It's huge!
I've never imagined an art piece quite like this one
"An unknown world floats within the darkness"
A face I've never seen looks back at me...it moved me.
I think I know why the moon is so beautiful
Here we go! "Uh-Ah" if I sing "Uh-Ah"
Here we go!!
Luna na Luna na Luna na
I can't tell just by looking at the exterior
Shadow and la la light la la light
This secret is like two sides of the same coin
Light and shadow, their aesthetic supports each other
If you seperate them, it's the same as nothing!!
Day and night, the darker it is, the more the contrast will increase
The shapes change depending on the angle of the sun, make up again
We're just like the moon
Shadow and light, a gravitational force pulls us together
A view that can be seen from 380,000 miles away
The paradigm has changed, eternity is not a lie
"An unknown world floats within the darkness"
Feel what is beyond the veil of oxygen with your eyes
The moon showed me that it all affects each other
Here we go! "Uh-Ah" if I sing "Uh-Ah"
Reflection
Luna na Luna na Luna na
I can't tell just by looking at the exterior
Shadow and la la light la la light
This secret is like two sides of the same coin
Life's blueprint, and flight paths
If it was easy, then no drama would've been born
Day and night, beauty appears in an endless loop
Everything has its own meaning, and it would be amazing to discover it
There's a paper-thin difference between contradictions
Shadow and light, a gravitational force pulls us together
Here we go! "Uh-Ah" a resonating glow..
Here we go! "Uh-Ah" if I sing "Uh-Ah"
Here we go!!
Luna na Luna na Luna na
I can't tell just by looking at the exterior
Shadow and la la light la la light
This secret is like two sides of the same coin
Light and shadow, their aesthetic supports each other
If you seperate them, it's the same as nothing!!
Day and night, the darker it is, the more the contrast will increase
The shapes change depending on the angle of the sun, make up again
We're just like the moon
Shadow and light, a gravitational force pulls us together
