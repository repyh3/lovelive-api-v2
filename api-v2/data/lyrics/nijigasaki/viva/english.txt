1, 2, Let it go! (Yeah)
It's time to go, Alright?
There's no way this isn't fun!
(We can go! We can Let it go!)
This excited feeling...
Where does it even come from, I wonder?
Oh-oh, the fun never ends when we're together!
Let's make our hearts race even more!
Carried on by the spring-colored winds,
Our tunes ring out far and wide
Let's make this the most heart-pounding experience ever
And move forward to what lies beyond!
This is a VIVA! VIVA! VIVA! kind of moment with you
There's still so much more to do
I want to make them bloom, my heart
Is connecting our hearts together
VIVA! VIVA! Our tears and our smiles
Will shine, will shine brightly forever!
To your heart
Let's feel this overflowing excitement together
I hope you're feeling the same way I am
While holding that wish close
Let's share what's in our hearts right now
VIVA! VIVA! VIVA!... VIVA! VIVA! VIVA!...
East, west, north, south; we can go across any sky, any sea, or any land
VIVA! VIVA! VIVA!... VIVA! VIVA! VIVA!...
Let's add color to this journey! Now, Buon Viaggio!
This is a VIVA! VIVA! VIVA! kind of moment with you
There's still so much more to do
I want to make them bloom, my heart
Is connecting our hearts together
VIVA! VIVA! Our tears and our smiles
Will shine, will shine brightly forever!
To your heart
Let's feel this overflowing excitement together
