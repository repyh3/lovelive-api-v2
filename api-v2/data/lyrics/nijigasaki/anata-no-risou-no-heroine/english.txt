After school, when everyone has left, in the corner of a hallway,
The dance hall is my own - a stage no one else knows of
It was a day like any other. I was practicing by myself,
And covered in sweat, when you happened to pass by
Every time we talk, a feeling in my chest starts overflowing
Like watching a good comedy, and I'm enveloped in happiness
May one of these days I become your ideal heroine
I'm bad at ad lib-ing. Lead me through with a nice scenario
The lines I memorized over and over, just don't come when I look in your eyes
So for now, please let me perform beside you simply as a junior partner
Unlike all the times before, my practicing alone
Doesn't feel so harsh ever since I've met you
Now, the expressiveness I've since lacked, I have
The curtain is rising quietly on the second chapter of my story
I want to be one who can bring a smile to someone else
But most of all, I want to bring a smile to you
May one of these days I become your ideal heroine
I'm bad at ad lib-ing. Lead me through with a nice scenario
The lines I memorized over and over, just don't come when I look in your eyes
So for now, please let me perform beside you simply as a junior partner
