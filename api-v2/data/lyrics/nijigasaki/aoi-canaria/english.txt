And so, the jade-green canary sings!
Deep down within my heart, my horrid, wandering feelings leave me unable to breathe
What is my purpose? For whom do I sing? Unable to find my answer, I continue to lie in wait
In the clutches of some unseen thread,
Ah, my emotions cry out, as if they're about to explode
Who cares if I'm a bit clumsy? I just want to be myself!
Now, let my intense feelings resonate! I'll sing from the very depths of my soul!
Starting today, I'm an absolutely, completely, totally different person
I'll spread my wings and fly ever freely in the vast skies above
So sings the jade-green canary!
Like clockwork, my lost wanderings have brought me back to where I started
I gaze longingly at the figure crossing the sky and shed a tear
If I stay like this, tomorrow will come without a change
Ah, I ache, my impulses making me feel like I'm going to explode
Who cares if I mess up? Regrets alone won't set me free!
Now, bring light to this deep darkness! I'll ride the winds of dawn!
This is my very own path, all the way to the distant future
I'll spread my wings and fly ever freely in the vast skies above
And keep on soaring
I'm not holding back anymore! My days as a good kid are over!
I'm not afraid anymore. I'll grasp true freedom in my own two hands!
Now, let my intense feelings resonate! I'll sing from the very depths of my soul!
Starting today, I'm an absolutely, completely, totally different person
I'll spread my wings and fly ever freely in the vast skies above
So sings the jade-green canary!
