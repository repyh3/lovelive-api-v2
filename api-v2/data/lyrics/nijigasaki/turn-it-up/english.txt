Stand up!!
coming up!!
Turn the music up!!
To re-play, lift the needle
And then I want you to put it back down
I've thought about something I haven't said yet
It's kind of embarrassing, so
I'll let the rhythm wash over me
Etch the 33RPM into my heart beat
Let's forget about our worries and dance
Turn it up!! Turn it up!! Turn the volume up
Listen up Listen Up!! Listen to my voice
A girl can have various sides to her
A-side, b-side, anything really
Please love all of me
I want you to accept me for who I am
Stand up!!
coming up!!
Turn the music up!!
If you use the needle to read my heart-beat,
Would you be able to hear how I'm feeling?
It's not like I'm hiding anything.
Today I want to get everything off my chest
A 7 inch donut disc is enough to convey it
If I'm honest, then it'll be easy saying how I feel, Ah
Turn it up!! Turn it up!! Turn the volume up
Listen up Listen Up!! Listen to my voice
A girl can have various sides to her
A-side, b-side, anything really
Please love all of me
I want you to accept me for who I am
Stand up!!
coming up!!
Turn the music up!!
