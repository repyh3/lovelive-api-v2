Ah easy tuning, so attached to you
I've been expecting you
Keep running, warning, turning, return back
I'll always be close by...
(OBEY)
Throw open the doors (feeling sad, oh so sad, oh so sad, oh so sad)
You need to breathe (take a deep breath, deep breath, deep breath)
The surrounding beauty is nothing
Compared to the lost lamb who remains before me
You won't regret living your life being under my control
How easy could it be to cut the rope that binds me?
Don't be absurd, nothing I say is a lie
You don't know what's "real"... so close your eyes
I whisper this into your ear
Ah easy tuning, so attached to you
I can see you trying to hide your fear
Embracing your heartbeat (from a good distance, distance, distance)
The pupae of a Hydra is (freezing below zero, zero, zero)
Now, what's been spilled cannot be wiped away
The aquarium's stagnation is raining down on us
You don't know anything about praise or aestheticism
Can that tied rope be unravelled without being cut?
It's so "foolish" of you
To ask such a question... so close your eyes
I'll always be close by
Ah easy tuning, so attached to you
You're meant to be here
Ah, inside tuning, Soul, Touch, to me
I'll always be with you
Don't be robbed of your
Happiness and love
Bite through the chains on your heart
If you can save yourself, you might even become the devil
You won't regret living your life being under my control
How easy could it be to cut the rope that binds me?
It's so "foolish" of you
To ask such a question... so close your eyes
I whisper this into your ear
Ah easy tuning, so attached to you
What's to come will last forever...
