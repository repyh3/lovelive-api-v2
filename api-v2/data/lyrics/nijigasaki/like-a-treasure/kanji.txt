The words I said to you back on that very day
Came in a way that pushed my true feelings away
It wasn't what I meant
The weight in my heart is misplaced
Hiding my intent
不器用で傷つけてごめんね
大人ぶって背伸びをしてた
本当の思いは
ひとつしかないのに
I would like to hold tight to each moment that flows with you
Ah　キミと過ごす時間の全部
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Moments we unite in time
Are like treasures
このまま　キミとの
未来を hold and can't let it go
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Want us to be side by side
僕達らしくね　重ねるメロディ
It will keep on resounding so true
With you forever
Like a treasure
Like a treasure
Let's keep moving through
Hand in hand, me and you
Together feeling new
The words you gave to me ignite
Sparks inside
The light you gave me, burning bright
Hearts collide
Now, you belong right in my life
And it took time to realize
But now, I feel like it has always been this way
This feeling still unverified
キミの隣なら
This must be the way
Fears I push away
I hope you feel the same
I would like to hold tight to each moment that flows with you
Ah　君がいる景色の全部
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Moments we unite in time
Are like treasures
このまま　キミとの
未来を hold and can't let it go
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Want us to be side by side
僕達らしくね　重ねるメロディ
そう響きわたってく
With you forever
With you forever
With you forever
Now, now, now, now
With you forever
