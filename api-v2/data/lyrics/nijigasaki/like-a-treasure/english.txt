The words I said to you back on that very day
Came in a way that pushed my true feelings away
It wasn't what I meant
The weight in my heart is misplaced
Hiding my intent
I'm sorry for hurting you with my clumsiness
I was pretending to be an adult, standing on my tiptoes
But the truth is,
My heart only ever had one real feeling
I would like to hold tight to each moment that flows with you
Ah, from all the time I spend with you
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Moments we unite in time
Are like treasures
Just like this, with you
It's our future I hold and can't let it go
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Want us to be side by side
Let's layer our melody in a way that's true to us
It will keep on resounding so true
With you forever
Like a treasure
Like a treasure
Let's keep moving through
Hand in hand, me and you
Together feeling new
The words you gave to me ignite
Sparks inside
The light you gave me, burning bright
Hearts collide
Now, you belong right in my life
And it took time to realize
But now, I feel like it has always been this way
This feeling still unverified
If I'm next to you
This must be the way
Fears I push away
I hope you feel the same
I would like to hold tight to each moment that flows with you
Ah, from every part of the scenery with you in it
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Moments we unite in time
Are like treasures
Just like this, with you
It's our future I hold and can't let it go
I know every time it's you and I
Our true feelings intertwine
Want us to be side by side
Let's layer our melody in a way that's true to us
It will keep on resounding so true
With you forever
With you forever
With you forever
Now, now, now, now
With you forever
