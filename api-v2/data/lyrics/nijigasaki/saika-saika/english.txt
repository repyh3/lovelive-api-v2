What time is it right now?
I’ll start preparing from the morning, so I don’t mess up
Tonight, I'll dress myself in my favourite colors and patterns
Clip-clop, I'm not used to these shoes
Didon-Didon, "I just got here”
I found you in front of the shrine
We stand side by side in the crowd
Holding hands so we don't get separated
Hey, can you hear that? It's like summer is calling!
Clap your hands; everyone dance!
Flowers are blooming in the night sky
The pipes and drums sing
Tonight is a festival
In a flash, fireworks bloom far above us
The cotton candy starts to dissolve
If the two of us share it, it turns out to be this sweet huh?
(Yeah!) More than anyone else
(Hoo!) I’ve got to enjoy myself!
C'mon, show me more smiles
Let’s decorate today and everyday with them!
How about we look over there?
It's a tank filled with water balloons
Let's have a little match of goldfish scooping!
Splish-splash, the sound of splattering droplets
Your green yo-yo
Make a ruckus, just like a child would
Amidst the bustle, time flows by
One by one, the memories start to pile up
Since summer isn't over yet
Clap your hands; everyone sing!
Send the shouts into the heavens
Make as much noise as you wish
Tonight is a festival
Let it dance beautifully
Let it echo strongly
A blooming flower will capture a person's heart and not let go
With you again; I want to see it with you again
Take me to the sky, I draw out my wish
It's beautiful, isn’t it? It's beautiful, right?
Again. Yes, again.
Because summer is coming
Clap your hands; everyone dance!
Flowers are blooming in the night sky
The pipes and drums sing
Tonight is a festival
Lalala..
