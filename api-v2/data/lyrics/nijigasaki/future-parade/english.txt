We look up at the sky
And a rainbow brilliantly stretches beyond it
Our stories are woven together from this thrill
The future keeps on expanding forever
And it's truly endless
The heartbeat of someone's dream starts beating faster
This baton that's overflowing with feelings
Let's pass it on
New (courage and) encounters and (harmonies)
Are being created
Let's go together
That means you, too!!
The wind of beginnings shines
Towards the twinkling tomorrow
Your feelings
I just know they'll bloom
You're never alone
At any time
I'll envision this with you forever
The rainbow of dreams will always be in our hearts
And it connects us
We continue to look back
At the colorful dreams we carved along the way.
True stories glimmer in every moment
Smiles, sadness and hesitation have their own color
The future is infinite
Let's create it together:
A world where a rainbow blooms
We'll send a cheer to
Your wavering heart
Just one (step of) courage (is all it takes)
To change
Let's go together.
That means everyone!
The wind of beginnings flutters
Look, we're standing with you
Your feelings
You're waiting to take flight
We're here for you
At any time
Don't worry, we're all together
Your rainbow will always be in our hearts
We're running towards tomorrow!
Our encounters and dreams are ah, shining now
The wind of beginnings shines
Towards the twinkling tomorrow
Your feelings
I just know they'll bloom
You're never alone
At any time
I'll envision this with you forever
The rainbow of dreams will always be in our hearts
And it connects us
The light; let's follow it
You and us, let's move forward
Go for dream; as many times as it takes
Our dreams, our dreams, let's chase after them!
