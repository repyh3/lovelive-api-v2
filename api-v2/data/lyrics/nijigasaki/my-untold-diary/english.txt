Holiday: The scenery was reflected on the train
Windows in a different way than usual
Today, the silhouettes that I see
Becomes a frame that belongs only to me
The waves on the beach are hazy
And the city is blurred in the distance
I unfold my imagination,
Writing a secret scenario of my own
It's a phrase that keeps on dancing,
Unseen by anyone's eyes, layering colors as it goes on
I lock this moment into a page,
My fingertips gently trace its shape
Each time the train stops at a station, umbrellas bloom like flowers
And my imagination swells again
While wishing for the day
My future self smiles
Oh, my untold diary
Find a way - I caught the scent of the sea
I wonder if I've passed Enoshima yet
The rails gently resonate
Guiding me into the next scene
Next to the voices of people having fun
In front of the aquarium
The profile sitting still on the bench
Is searching for hope
No one can see it, but I am still writing,
It's being kept somewhere inside my heart
Where should I put my bookmark on this page
That locks away this moment?
With the announcement at the station,
The image changes again as the pages continue to turn
While wishing for the day my future self
Will nod in approval
Oh, my untold diary
Moving slowly, step by step,
Into an unfamiliar world of a quiet little journey
Even after closing my notebook on the swaying seat,
Everything remains vivid
It's a phrase that keeps on dancing,
Unseen by anyone's eyes, layering colors as it goes on
I lock this moment into a page,
My fingertips gently trace its shape
Each time the train stops at a station, umbrellas bloom like flowers
And my imagination swells again
While wishing for the day
My future self smiles
Oh, my untold diary
