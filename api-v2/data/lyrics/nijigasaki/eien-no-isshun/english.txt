We hold each other's hands tightly;
There will come a day
When we'll have to let go
But, I won't cry anymore
Lift your face and give me a smile
Let's make the best memories
The sun is setting outside the window
Today is coming to an end again
This sunset will disappear soon
But I don't want to forget its beauty
This thing known as the present,
I wonder if this is what others call "eternity", maybe
The feelings we formed will last forever
And connect us to each other
Gripping your hand tightly
Putting our hands to our chest
I promise our friendship will last forever
Thank you, I'm glad we met
I care about you dearly
On the days when I was upset
And now that we're happily chatting
When I think about it,
You were always there to support me
Even those uneventful days
Will be a special page of our youth
The days we spent with everyone
Will continue to shine
We hold each other's hands tightly;
There will come a day
When we'll have to let go
But, I won't cry anymore
Lift your face and give me a smile
Let's make the best memories
I wish we could stay like this forever
But I know, seasons come and go
I don't want to have any regrets
So I'll run as fast as I can
Gripping your hand tightly
Putting our hands to our chest
I promise our friendship will last forever
Thank you, I'm glad we met
I want to feel it for a little longer
This moment of eternity
