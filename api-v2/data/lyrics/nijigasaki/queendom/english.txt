Have I heard the rumors?
Of course I have, that's right!
Everyone longs for it
(Yes, I'm so special)
But I still don't
Have enough ambition
Yes, I'm the best!!
I'll take control of everything about you
Come on, take a look at my burning heart
We're starting a revolution
The golden time!
A premonition is starting to form in this unknown world
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
Say goodbye to common sense!
I may give you
A chance to open up
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
I will not allow these orders!
You can't take your eyes off me, right?
Come on! Come on!
The golden time!
A premonition is starting to form in this unknown world
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
No problem!
Welcome to the Queendom
It's not merely strength
But also a hidden secret
It's a piece of jewelry that combines everything
(A special existence!)
I'll dance gorgeously
Can you bear
My temptation?
Anything you ask, I'll make your wish come true.
So take a look at this passionate beat!
There's a legend that will go down in history
Let's start showtime
Raise the curtains for it's the start of a new era!
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
Say goodbye to the usual!
I wake and open up my eyes
To see the next stage!
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
I won't let you boss me around!
Don't refuse me, just let yourself go
The music will play for as long as I want it to
(Sha-lala..)
I'll wait to welcome you on the other side
A premonition is starting to form in this unknown world
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
Say goodbye to common sense!
I may give you
A chance to open up
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
I will not allow these orders!
You can't take your eyes off me, right?
Come on! Come on!
The golden time!
A premonition is starting to form in this unknown world
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
No problem!
