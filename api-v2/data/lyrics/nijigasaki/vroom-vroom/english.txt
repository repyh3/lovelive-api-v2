Feel it, Feel it, right?!
We should speak up, let's get together
C'mon, it's time to stand up! All the girls
In this world, it doesn't matter where we are
We were born to be shining
Go ahead! Tell me! Yay yay yay yeah
Follow me! Right now! Yay yay yay yeah
Make a noise in the world; the time has come
Are you ready? Let's talk about it
At first, even if we were hostile and rivals
We respect and help each other improve, it's wonderful
