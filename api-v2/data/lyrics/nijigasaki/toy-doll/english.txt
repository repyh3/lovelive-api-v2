Here we go, we go, we gotta go
'Cause I know, I know that miracles
Really do come true
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Three, two, one, let's go!
Come again? Tell me when you will understand
Don't pretend 'cause you're turning red again
Hey hey hey hey!
It's okay, I don't hate having company
We can call this a date now, don't you think?
Hey hey hey hey!
I know you like how I treat you like a toy doll
Play you around till you're begging that you want it all
Why don't we try going to a different level
Wanna play "house" with me?
Here we go, we go, we gotta go
'Cause I know, I know that miracles
Really do come true
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Let's go!
You and me, a team, how brilliant!
Now you'll see how sweet I really am
Don't you fall for me
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Three, two, one, let's go!
I don't know why you're so crazy into me
Wanting more than before it's plain to see
Hey hey hey hey!
Won't deny, I kinda like playing hard to get
Take your time, but you're mine so don't forget
Hey hey hey hey!
I've been a good girl it's time for you to pay up
And if you could baby no complaining, please shut up
I caught you looking so I deserve this back rub
A little lower, oh! Right there!
Here we go, we go, we gotta go
We are young and wild and powerful
Ready to explore
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Let's go!
You and me can be unstoppable
Flying free and taking on the world
Curious to see
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Three, two, one, let's go!
Hey hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey!
Everyone wants their fun, it's hard to trust somebody
But somehow when I'm with you I feel at ease
You're so funny when I tease you
But I won't let them see
Nobody else allowed but me
Yeah
Day by day I laugh a little more
Cause my world is brighter than before
And it's thanks to you
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Let's go!
Here we go, we go, we gotta go
'Cause I know, I know that miracles
Really do come true
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Let's go!
You and me, a team, how brilliant!
Now you'll see how sweet I really am
Don't you fall for me
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Three, two, one, let's go!
Hey hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey!
