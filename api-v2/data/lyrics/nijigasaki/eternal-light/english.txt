Hey, I want you to see me
Feel the heartbeat...Yeah
"Let's go!" 3, 2, 1, DD!!!
One million lights exist in this world
Who taught me that? That's you
These happy feelings, this enjoyable view
Don't make that face, look at me now
I'm going to pull you out of your shell
Let it go, we go; that smile...
It's like you just can't wait!
I want us to understand each other's feelings
But my head just spins round and round
(Cause I can't stop) I found the voice within my heart
(You'll find a way) Just do what you want to do
Don't you think? So let's go for it!
"Ready?"
Let's go! Step into the new world
Show me your true self
Try reaching out your hand, go on
You're the only one and you're wonderful
Let's go! Step into the new world
Hey, I want you to realize it
(I'm going to feel this through my whole body and sing with everything I have)
Until I get through to you!
I can definitely feel this bond that we have
It goes on forever beyond time.. Eternal Light
You're always hiding, anxious and conflicted
Doing things this way is like being stuck in a maze
Your dreams were born to be filled with doubt
(Bu-But!) You gave me a kindness
You gave me, gave me a smile
This time now, I'll be the one to give you a good time
You rescued me
You helped me so many times
I want to support you in the future
But these regrets spin round and round
(Just let me know) Carrying the sound of doubts in your heart
(So U&I) Just face them as you are
Don't you think? Then let's go for it!
"Come on!"
Let's go! Step into the new world
Let's greet our future selves
Once you start running, you can't stop; go on
Just keep on dreaming, it'll be okay
Let's go! Step into the new world
Even in the darkest of nights,
Surely our bond will protect us
It goes on forever, Eternal Light
"I believe in you
Nothing is impossible"
So many lights are endlessly passing through time
The future can't help but exist forever and ever!
I can hear it, my eager heartbeat and the light that connects us
Never ever, because it won't disappear
Let's go! Step into the new world
Show me your true self
Try reaching out your hand, go on
You're the only one and you're wonderful
Let's go! Step into the new world
Hey, I want you to realize it
(I'm going to feel this through my whole body and sing with everything I have)
Until I get through to you!
I can definitely feel this bond that we have
It goes on forever beyond time.. Eternal Light
