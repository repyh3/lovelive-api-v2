My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
I lose track of time
When I'm with you
A blanket of pure white snow
Spreads out as far as the eye can see,
And forms a brightly sparkling panorama.
The wind is dancing softly
When we cross paths, our eyes meet
With a "thump", my heart starts thriving
Into this rapidly accelerating scenery
Now, let's dive right in
If this is destiny...
Then I won't let it go, don't fade away
I'll hold it strong within my hands
My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
I want to stop time
If there's a future for the both of us
I wish your hand would come and reach out
And don't let go (In this scenery)
So, is the magic real?
The magic won't fade as long as you are here
Doesn't the warmth feel so indulgent?
In the warmth of my stove
But if you were to venture outside
There's the thrill that I love
Your smile seems to melt my heart
Something's about to happen
For you and I?
New feelings breaking free
They're overflowing
Hold me tight, until the snow
Around us melts, Strong and tight
I hope it lasts eternally
My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
I want to stop time
If there's a future for the both of us
I wish your hand would come and reach out
And don't let go (In this scenery)
So, is the magic real?
The magic won't fade as long as you are here
Sliding down with an impulsive determination,
My inflamed heart now ignites
My heartbeat grows louder
Feelings are mixing up with the thrill
I want to seize and keep this precious time
Inhale the fresh air of this view so vast and high
In the white delight
My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
I want to stop time
If there's a future for the both of us
I wish your hand would come and reach out
And don't let go (In this scenery)
So, is the magic real?
The magic won't fade as long as we're together
New beginnings are about to start
