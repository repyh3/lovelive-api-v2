My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
I lose track of time
Kimi to iketara
Ichimen ni hirogaru
Masshiroi yuki ga
Kirari hikaru panorama
Sotto kaze ga mau
Surechigau tabi Eye to eye
Doki tte hazumu mune wa Thrive
Sokudo ageteku keshiki ni
Now, let's dive right in
Unmei da to shitara...
Nogasenai yo Don't fade away
I'll hold it strong within my hands
My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
Toki o tometai
Futari no mirai ga aru nara
I wish your hand would come and reach out
Hanasanai (In this scenery)
So, is the magic real?
Mahou wa tokenai kimi ga iru nara
Atatakasa kokochi ii ne
In the warmth of my stove
Demo soto ni tobidaseba
There's the thrill that I love
Kokoro saratteku youna Your smile
Nanika hajimarisou na
For you and I?
New feelings breaking free
Afureru hodo ni
Yuki mo tokechau kurai ni
Gyutte shite Strong and tight
I hope it lasts eternally
My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
Toki o tometai
Futari no mirai ga aru nara
I wish your hand would come and reach out
Hanasanai (In this scenery)
So, is the magic real?
Mahou wa tokenai kimi ga iru nara
Suberidashita ikioi no mama
Hoteru My heart ima Ignite
Takanaru mune ni
Feelings are mixing up with the thrill
I want to seize and keep this precious time
Inhale the fresh air of this view so vast and high
In the white delight
My heartbeat's spiking up, the pace is high
This view of endless scenes of white is glowing bright
Toki o tometai
Futari no mirai ga aru nara
I wish your hand would come and reach out
Hanasanai (In this scenery)
So, is the magic real?
Mahou wa tokenai kimi to futari nara
New beginnings are about to start
