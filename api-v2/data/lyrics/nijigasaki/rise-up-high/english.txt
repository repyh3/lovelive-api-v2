Let's go! Enjoy! The voltage is rising
Clap your hands to the beat
Let's go! Enjoy! It's about to start, don't miss it
This moment will be so amazing that you'll even forget to blink
I'm carried away by the sound of the waves
Under an endless blue sky
I'm sure it's thanks to the sea breeze
And the sun that I feel so bold
With more passion than anyone else
I'm going to capture your gaze and heart
I'll take all the attention!
I can't stay still any longer
With my own hands, I'll start things with a bang, let's go!
Let's go! Enjoy! The voltage is at its peak
Let me hear your pounding hearts
Let's go! Enjoy! This incredible stage
Will be etched into your memory
Embraced by the dazzling noize
A new world is awakening
Shed your doubts, and show your true self
Let's have a blast with you!
Under a sun that never sleeps,
A mirage reflects in your eyes
It's your fault that my endless passion
Rises along with the sweat that I shed
Every second, every moment, my heart races
I'm going to monopolize your
Most passionate feelings!
I won't let you feel bored
When you feel the rhythm, take my hand, let's go!
Rise Up High!
Let's dance the way we feel
On a hot sandy beach,
I wished this would never end
Feel the sound forever and ever
Let's go! Enjoy! The voltage is rising
Clap your hands to the beat
Let's go! Enjoy! It's about to start
We'll live through this incredible moment together
Let's go! Enjoy! The voltage is at its peak
Let me hear your pounding hearts
Let's go! Enjoy! This incredible stage
Will be etched into your memory
Wrapped in the best memories for all eternity
