I found you!
You had your eyes on me, too
Is this where it all begins?
It's actually already begun (Now, let's go)
Feelings (we have so many of them)
Once they connect (it cheers us up!)
Let our hearts become stronger and let's work even harder
So at any time, our dream is our sun
After we cry, let's put a smile on our faces
And talk about the future
At any time, our dream is our sun
Even if the wind or rain hit hard
Remember, there's a light that shines down on us
I'm going to try to give it my all again today
I miss you!
My honest feelings are filling up inside me
I'm so full of them, I've turned to my voice to express...
For I send this, (I love you)
We bumped into each other (Why?)
We'll bump into each other again soon (We'll figure out why soon, surely!)
I believe in the passion that we'll understand ourselves someday
I wonder in what dream you'd like to dance
The paths of ours cross
And that's when things get interesting
In what dream do you want to dance?
Tell me, please! It sounds fun
I'd love to know the rainbow your eyes are looking for
I won't give up, not yet
I never want to give up, I don't want to give up everything so quickly
I know we feel the same way, am I right? Let's try harder, once again
So at any time, our dream is our sun
After we cry, let's put a smile on our faces
And talk about the future
At any time, our dream is our sun
Even if the wind or rain hit hard
Remember, there's a light that shines down on us
I'll give it my all today.
I'm going to try to give it my all again tomorrow
I feel like I can go anywhere
Just continue being yourself... You can go anywhere you want!
