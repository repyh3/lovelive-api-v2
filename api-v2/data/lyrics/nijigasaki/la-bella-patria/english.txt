I'm sure our dreams are waiting for us
Right here, in this very place
I want to go beyond this clear, blue sky
And tell you even more
Once the door of unknown fates
Opens at last (it's heart-pounding)
A new world awaits
I know it's frightening, but
Inside of this trunk
Is a loadful of memories
So let's hold onto them tightly
All of the feelings (inside my chest)
Are beginning to race (they are)
And I know it's very difficult
To have to lie to them (am I right?)
So I'll just listen closely to my heart
I'm sure our dreams are going to awaken
Right here, in this very place
They'll be shining (and in that moment)
My hand's going to reach for them
I'm gonna make them come true
No matter what happens from here on out
I won't let go (of my feelings)
I'll change them into courage instead
This beautiful homeland
Surely, this song will reach you
I want to head towards
The start of my new stage (I can't wait for)
The world I've dreamed of
Look around, and comprehend the world
These mysteries I want to touch
Are filling me up
I'm not alone (I'm not lonely)
Everyone's voices are (right here)
Every time I hear them
My chest just dances (always)
As my heart flows with anticipation
I'm sure that when tomorrow comes
My dreams will be connected
I'll be running off (and in that moment)
I'll keep believing and move on
I'm gonna make them come true
No matter what happens from here on out
With everyone (together)
It just makes me smile
This beautiful family
Surely, this song will resonate with you
When all these dreams come together
A new dream will come along
So, let's make them come true!
Encounters are like miracles
You can find them in this city
Don't worry
Because I'm spending time with everyone I love
I'm not alone
Because my heart leaps (always)
Overflowing with love inside my heart
I'm sure that when tomorrow comes
My dreams will be connected
They'll be shining (and in that moment)
I'll keep believing and move on
I'm gonna make them come true
No matter what happens from here on out
With everyone (together)
It just makes me smile
This beautiful homeland
To that completed sky
I'm sure that someday
This song will reach you
