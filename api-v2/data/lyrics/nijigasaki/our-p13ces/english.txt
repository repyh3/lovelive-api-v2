Go for it!
All the best
Let's draw the future together!
Let's continue walking to the end of the rainbow (it'll be okay)
Even if there's sorrow, (hey, look)
It'll be sunny in no time
Overflowing with love
It'll continue for eternity (the bond in our hearts)
All the way into the sky
Look at the (exciting events)
Brand new dreams (keep coming one after another)
This excitement keeps us up at night
(Like a child)
We like you, we love you
The melody won't stop playing
Because we want to protect your smile
Shining fantastic dreamer
We're glowing
Our glory won't stop, we'll keep spinning it
Our story won't end, we'll stay for a little longer
(An unyielding friendship, an eternal azure sky)
No matter what happens, we're always on your side
We'll head towards the hand in front of us
Happiness is bound to arrive
We'll grab your hand right now
The sky is hazy, and the raindrops are (sparkling)
I look up and smile, (so thrilling) a fiery smile
We'll sing over and over again
And bookmark it (For You For You For You)
So we can remember this moment
When it's about
(Bigger than that sky)
A blank canvas
(Future colored paint)
There are no rules here
(It's up to you)
We won't stop loving you
Our bond is unshakable
We'll hold you close
Shining fantastic dreamer
We're dazzling
Running up to tomorrow, while holding hands
Your cheers support us, rain or shine
(Crying and laughing, a prism of tears)
No matter what happens, we'll be together
We'll head towards the hand in front of us
Happiness is bound to arrive
It'll be your turn next time
Keep it up
The bright future
Let's make your color of the rainbow bloom
The smiling flowers that bloomed and bloomed
with you with you with you
This song is our treasure
Shining fantastic dreamer
It's fate
Our miraculous encounter, we'll keep spinning it
Our story won't end, we'll stay for a little longer
(An unyielding friendship, an eternal azure sky)
No matter what happens, I'm always on your side
We'll head towards the hand in front of us
Happiness is bound to arrive
Goodbye to this era
OUR P13CES connect us!
Go for it!
All the best
Let's draw the future together!
