The flames burning in my heart
Let's launch them high into the sky
Breaking through the cloudy sky
My feelings of "love" are in full swing
Let's bloom even more brightly
Our lives, our smiles
This endlessly overflowing power
When something's "fun", it's seriously unbeatable
I want to light up the whole world
Spark it up! Spark and burst!
There are walls I could never get past alone
But together, we can break through anything!
I want to tell you that "I love you"
It doesn't matter what time it is, these feelings overflow
The thought of "I love you" always comes to mind
I want this voice to echo anywhere and everywhere
With my heart dancing, and my heart ablaze
I can chase what I love with everything I've got
With our hearts in sync, we bloom into smiles
Being able to love something is the best, ah
As I run through the night sky
My feelings of "love" are in full bloom
Unleashing our colors
Our voice, our Light
I can really feel your power
And all the love and feelings you put into it
So that the whole world can hear it
Amp it up! Blast it up!
Don't hang your head low all alone
I want to sing with you until your heart clears up again
What kind of sky do you like? What kind of tomorrow do you want?
Let's cast a rainbow across the future we long for!
I want our trembling "I love you"s
To overlap and make this shared moment bloom
"I'll always love you" no matter how many times
No matter how many times it blooms, I want its sound to soar into the vast sky
With my heart dancing, and my heart ablaze
I can chase what I love with everything I've got
Even if it's light-years away, beyond the furthest stars
I want this light inside me to shine out and reach you, ah
Connecting with everyone and spreading it further
Circle of love
