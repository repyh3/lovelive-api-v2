Singing on, more now, more now
Dreaming on, more now
Singing on, more now, more now
I'm in a room, alone, all on my own
And I've been looking for that smile, all along
My eyes set on the screen
Now it is glowing on
The night is so long
As I recall the day I spoke to you
My heart is burning with devotion for our dream
Whoa whoa whoa
Longing to meet
Whoa whoa whoa
Moving beyond the clouds ahead
(My Heart) Even if we're so far apart
(Your Heart) I know we're together at heart
The sky is brightening as I'm moving toward you and we ride the wave
This is our
Loving! Loving! Loving!
Here, deep and complete
Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!
We could finally meet
When your thoughts (and my own) overlap (resonate) and play out the story
Let's sing on
Loving! Loving! Loving!
What a special dream
Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!
The shining future's waiting
(With a bond made out of love)
Let's go and be as one
To grow in this world
Singing on, more now, more now
Dreaming on, more now
Singing on, more now, more now
It is you I wanna meet
Though we're so far away
I feel the heat taking over my heart
Call aloud with your voice
And hand in hand, now we can start
Sky is so bright, you and I, let's go
Oh we're gonna flow to the heights unknown
To that future where lights await
Been around from the opening page
(Our Days) the never ending smiles
(Our Wish) and an endless warm emotion
Heading toward a brand new day
Let's go on We'll find a way
Resonate
Loving! Loving! Loving!
In this melody
Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!
Riding on the wind
With the dream (with the dream) go beyond (go beyond) and achieve the story
Let's sing on
Loving! Loving! Loving!
What a special dream
Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!
The shining future's waiting
(With a bond made out of love)
Let's go and be as one
To grow in this world
All together here, we are connecting the best moment we can view
The sky's never-ending, always accrues
The freedom that unveils
Forever to go
This is our
Loving! Loving! Loving!
Here, deep and complete
Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!
We could finally meet
When your thoughts (and my own) overlap (resonate) they play out the story
Let's sing on
Loving! Loving! Loving!
What a special dream
Jumping! Jumping! Jumping!
The shining future's waiting
(With a bond made out of love)
Let's go and be as one
Stepping from this world
It's you and me, we're going toward that light ahead
