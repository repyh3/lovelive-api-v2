Today was again like one of those stories of fluttering away
I feel like I was left behind
That honest smile, that always gave itself over to its feelings,
is far away
Since when could it have been?
My ideal self seems to be closing by
Yet your wish being the first is fine for me
I am really fine with this. It should be that way... but why?
My dearest
I can't push myself into your heart
But if you were to indulge me, just a little
Then hold me within your arms
The real me, who is weak until I fall apart
I've decided from the beginning
That purely you are everything
Sometimes it feels weird
I wish I could put it into words
Hey, what happened?
Just from being by a crowd
That it's a shining reflection of you
Yes, It's an unmistakable truth
My dearest
I can't push myself into your heart
If you are reborn
Forget everything like a child
I want to slowly sleep on your arm
Now you're more important than anyone
Break out of here
Just listen to me for a little bit
Can you reach for that desire?
Thank you for listening to my true feelings.
Would you ever be able to accept me like this?
I can't push myself into your heart
But if you were to indulge me, just a little
The real me, who is weak
Then hold me within your arms
The hidden real me, who is weak
I just want you to love me, I'll fall apart
