Do you have some time, some time,
To spare right now?
I want to tell you something today
(Dear my friends!!)
The truth is, the truth is
I always wanted to tell you
Thank you always and always.
(My precious friends)
We like to always do our best
(We won't lose! We won't lose!)
If you ever come by, (Go, go!) we'll be waiting here
The way we come together is sparkling (Yes!)
Rainbow colors start overflowing (Yes!)
That we met is a greater miracle than any treasure
Our love is starting to bloom (Yes!)
This dream we all have
Together we'll make it real
Let's jump into a bright tomorrow
Love U my friends
My heart beats, my heart beats
I'm shaking with excitement
We get so hyped while we're together
(Dear my friends!!)
I'm getting thrilled more and more
Though it's changed some
Even now, that scenery
(I'll never forget it)
Do you remember our promise?
"Of course! Of course!"
That oath in our hearts, (Go, go!) let's sing it again today!
Our world is twinkling (Yes!)
With rainbow colors overflowing (Yes!)
As many times as we like, we can set off for the future we dreamed of
Our love is starting to bloom (Yes!)
This dream we all have
Together we'll make it real
Let's jump into a bright tomorrow
Love U my friends
Suddenly, the door is closed
There are days when you're frustrated
Even so, even so
All you have to do is smile!
Time to time, we fight
Then get anxious being alone
Then, after some tears
We can see a rainbow from afar!
The way we come together is sparkling (Yes!)
Rainbow colors start overflowing (Yes!)
That we met is a greater miracle than any treasure
Our love is starting to bloom (Yes!)
This dream we all have
Together we'll make it real
Let's jump into a bright tomorrow
Love U my friends
