Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss; love me, love me

Glancing quickly at you
I don't think I can wait any longer
Hey, please look at me!
(Give me Give me Love in Love in Chu-Chu♡)
This and that, my heart is in a frenzy
Whose fault do you think it is?
(Give me Give me Love in Love in Chu-Chu♡)
Oh dear.. even my best trap didn't work
I'll improve myself daily by updating my skill set
I don't believe in fortune telling, but I won't give up on you!
I'm gonna win you over, baby
I'm in love with Magic, and I can't stop it
These rising feelings are like a roller-coaster ride
Holding me tight makes my heart race! You're not being fair.
I'm in love with Magic, this is really Lu-La-La-Love♡
I'm overflowing with so many emotions
What are you doing to me?
Ah, I love this, I really do. Don't let this love end.
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss; love me, love me
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss; in love, love with you
I don't think my appeal got through to you at all
Please let it get through your thick head!
(Give me Give me Love in Love in Chu-Chu♡)
I'm too cute to waste, aren't I?
I'm being greedy. Do I want you that badly?

It's a trial & error put on repeat
If I could be in a special relationship with you, I'd be happy forever!
Hey, boy!
It can't be seen, like a border line
We're so close to the signs of infatuation
Yet, we can't reach it. Why is it so hard to understand?!
Heart-shaped eyes create a love trap
Oh baby, please call me
Be honest with me!
Magic, and I can't stop it
These rising feelings are like a roller-coaster ride
Holding me tight makes my heart race! You're not being fair.
