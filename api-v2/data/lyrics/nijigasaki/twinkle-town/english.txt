Silent night, Holy night, Twinkle in our town
Uh, Oh, What a Happy day!
Now It's the day that lights are twinkling in the sky
Today I'm going into town, to a place more fantasy-like
Let's go to where the usual "DoReMi"
Is playing in the background
I'll place the star on the top of the tree
One, two, three!
Everyone's welcome to come along
Oh, the illumination's (lights are)
Reflected in your eyes (in your eyes)
Can you hear the bell of joy? (Let's hang out to the Christmas Christmas town!)
Let's sing!
Twinkle Twinkle Silent Night
In this very festive season, YES! Everyone is
Gathered together and feeling happy
Twinkle Twinkle Holy Night
Yes, he'll make your wishes come true
And he'll give you anything you want
I'm sure he's coming
To this town, HO-HO-HO!
Look, Santa Claus is coming to our town!
Is it a chocolate cake? Is the chicken fried or roasted?
I can hear the bells ringing
I'm feeling excited! C'mon, let's go!
Today is the most fantastic day in this town
There's a choir singing
"La la la" on the street corner
Oh, there's the markets (where to next?)
Let's buy a matching set (but there's only one)
There are countless dreams
In this ever expanding world
Let's sing!
Twinkle Twinkle Silent Night
In this very festive season, YES! Everyone is
Having fun and smiling a lot
Twinkle Twinkle Holy Night
Yes, he'll make your wishes come true
I'll hope I can see you smiling some more
Snow is gently falling to the ground
Making this town so soft
Yes, the whitest snow is coming to our town!
Let's sing!
Twinkle Twinkle Silent Night
YES! The sparkle in this town
Is embraced by everyone's smiles
Twinkle Twinkle Holy Night
Yes, he'll make your wishes come true
So let's pray, give back and sing
Can you have a look to see if I tied the ribbon properly?
I'll be there, waiting to give you this smile for you!
I'm sure he's coming
To this town soon, HO-HO-HO!
Look, Santa Claus is coming to our town!
Santa Claus is coming to our town!
