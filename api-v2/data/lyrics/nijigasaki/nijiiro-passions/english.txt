Let's go to tomorrow!
With rainbow melodies
The rain clears up and reveals blue skies
And the winds of hope blow (Blowing)
We can feel something coming
And then we take our first steps
The world is sparkling
My heart starts welling up with (Feeling)
"We want to start running now...!!"
(Move on! Move on!)
These tiny melodies keep blending together (Our Colors)
Come on, let's paint an arch
That resonates through the cities
(Reaching for far blue sky!)
And sing together!
All of my feelings are overflowing
There's just no way to stop them
Rainbow-colored Passions!
Our colors are painted through courage
Let's make a bridge to the future
Beyond this never-ending sky
With a surging sympathy
Miracles will come to life
So let's go to tomorrow! With shining melodies
Yes, I know
I'm not alone
Everyone's always by my side
So let's connect our dreams together
The sunlight illuminates our path
As we jump over the puddles (Jumping)
I feel like we'll have higher expectations
If we're all together
A new season has started
The broken pieces of our hearts (Bye Bye)
Come on, just take them off
(Let go! Let go!)
If you start feeling uneasy (Got your back)
I want you to remember
The reason why I'm here
(Stand by you! We'll be right here!)
Let's sing together!
We'll keep on shining forever
The warmth of our chests won't ever disappear
Dream-colored Passions!
Our colors are drawn through courage
We won't ever think of giving up
We have to open the doors to the future
With an increasing empathy
We'll believe in miracles
So let's go to tomorrow with rainbow melodies!
In the calm night (at this moment)
This moment (remains right here)
As I'm caught up in the scent of this dream
I want to go more and more further, though
Until we reach tomorrow
We'll keep on shining forever
The warmth of our chests won't ever disappear
Dream-colored Passions!
Our colors are drawn through courage
All of my feelings are overflowing
There's just no way to stop them
Rainbow-colored Passions!!
Our colors are painted through courage
Let's make a bridge to the future
Beyond this never-ending sky
With a surging sympathy
Miracles will come to life
We'll always treasure the memories of our dreams
So let's go to tomorrow! With shining melodies
From now on
I'm not alone
Everyone will always be by my side
We'll make our dreams come true together
