Everyone is afraid
Of the world that awaits at the end of their dreams
Is it white? Black? Or even grey?
If we don't get that far, we'll never know
The truth is, you already have it
But you have to realize it for yourself
So don't fear, set your heart free now
Your smile makes miracles
It's always together with my wishes
C'mon, keep going! Sparkle!
Until you reach the future you believe in
Don't stop being brave
Make your feelings heard!
Be yourself
Powerfully and beautifully
Everyone is searching for something
Within the limited time they have
Is what I'm doing right? Or wrong?
Everything is uncertain
The truth is, you already know
That if you don't get hurt, you'll never reach anyone
Don't look away, see it with your own eyes
Your smile is the tracks you left behind
I swear I'll always guide you
C'mon, keep going! Shine!
Stand up, no matter how many times you fall!
Don't ever let your light go out
Make your feelings heard!
Be yourself
Powerfully and beautifully
It's okay to have weaknesses as long as you acknowledge them
It's no reason to give up
I've etched that into my heart
Your smile makes miracles
It's always together with my wishes
C'mon, keep going! Sparkle!
Until you reach the future you believe in
Don't stop being brave
Make your feelings heard!
Be yourself
Powerfully and beautifully
