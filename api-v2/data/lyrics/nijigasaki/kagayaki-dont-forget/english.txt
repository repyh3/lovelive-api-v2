Keep on dreaming!
What do you want now?
The answer is probably the same as mine, so let's go
Come with you to deliver that day more songs that we'll compose
We decided so, we're runners, who want to experience the excitement
The shape of your dream is not predetermined
The moment you realize it, it will be a new beginning, yes!
If you start running free, you can find your way
No one has ever walked on it, so you should try it!
I want to see the future, let's look into it — that's all we need, there is no other way!
Take care of the true desire of your heart, hi!
We felt the winds of different seasons
Ah, don't forget that we can run anywhere, yeah!
I want to see the future, let's look into it — that's all we need, there is no other way!
If only you accept the true desire of your heart, hi!
The energy, bubbling in you, and the rapid heartbeat will not stop already
Wherever we go, the colors of the rainbow won't stop sparkling.
Keep on dreaming!
Smiling suits you, so let's smile a lot today too
Let's chat all night long about your adventures, dream runners.
Rushing forward, not remembering yourself, and stumbling along the way
If you stop again, it will be a next beginning, yes!
There are no shortcuts, but taking a detour is fun
We'll make our every single dream come true, we just have to try it!
Let's do what we want, I want something wonderful, I want it!
The magic of words will be transformed, if you say it out loud, hi!
My chest warmed up with an energy I want to believe in.
The colors of the rainbow still, still don't stop sparkling in it.
Go!! Anywhere!
I won't forget this rapid heartbeat, I don't want to ever forget it.
In your and my eyes there is the same radiance.
I want to see the future, let's look into it — that's all we need!
Take care of the true desire of your heart, hi!
We felt the winds of different seasons
Ah, don't forget that we can run anywhere, yeah!
I want to see the future, let's look into it — that's all we need, there is no other way!
If only you accept the true desire of your heart, hi!
The energy, bubbling in you, and the rapid heartbeat will not stop already
Wherever we go, the colors of the rainbow won't stop sparkling.
Oh yeah, I won't forget
Hi, oh yeah, this thrilling song
Oh yeah, I won't forget
Hi, oh yeah, our days
