Even though the seasons have changed
My heart remains the same as it was back then (Think of you)
My happiness is running thin
And I'm left gasping, as if the air itself has abandoned me
We truly understood each other
Those were beautiful days
Don't tell me it was just an illusion - there's no way!
I keep swallowing it down until my throat is raw
You're hurting too, aren't you?
Let me know for sure - am I the only one?
That's crazy! Crazy!
Take it out, I believe in you
So, ease the ache and let me breathe
Let's stop pretending and become a true pair
On that homeward road, it was only us
Two shadows walking side by side (I miss you)
An afterimage isn't enough to hold
Because no matter where I look, you're right there
Whenever our eyes meet,
I know it's a special sign
As for me, I won't accept anything other than a happy ending
I keep swallowing it down until my throat is raw
You're hurting too, aren't you?
You got my hopes up, only to leave me with memories
That's crazy! Crazy!
Take it out, I won't let it end
So, come on and take responsibility now
And let's stay together forever, okay?
Like a thorn, it pierces deep
I can't keep swallowing this pain down
Prove it to me
Before everything breaks
Please, before this love turns into a sin
"Hey?"
I keep swallowing it down until my throat is raw
You're hurting too, aren't you?
Let me know for sure - am I the only one?
That's crazy! Crazy!
Take it out, I believe in you
So, ease the ache and let me breathe
Let's stop pretending and become a true pair
Please, don't let me go anymore
