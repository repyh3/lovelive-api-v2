(The world should be blue)
Let's check it out
A big adventure is about to begin
A journey of ocean blue dreams
If you shake your body
A smile will appear on your face
This is the ocean's world
The mermaids are also smiling
Keep believing in this connection
There is nothing to be afraid of
There is an azure future that is even more bluer than I imagined
Even in the ocean depths, we have to keep swimming!!
The dream world is beyond the sea!!
Let's find it together
It spreads endlessly
woh oh oh!! This wish as well
Isn't that so!? Beyond the line!!
Traveling beyond the faraway horizon
woh oh oh!! It'll definitely be there!
My future
(The world should be blue, right?)
Our glittering transformations
Sparkle with the colors of the future!
Let the vast ocean also become our friend
The southern utopia
The present day is far beyond what I imagined for the future
I'm on my way, full spead ahead!!
My expectations are infinite, beyond the sea!!
Let's try it together
Facing a never before seen future
woh oh oh!!
Why don't we make our choice and go beyond the line!!
Traveling beyond the shining horizon
woh oh oh!! We'll definitely cross it!
On our straightforward future blueprint
Our respective blues are
Intertwining and overlapping in this circular world
C'mon let's go!! Beyond the sea!!
Traveling beyond the faraway horizon
woh oh oh!! Let's explore it!
The blue that only belongs to us!
(Because the world is blue)
