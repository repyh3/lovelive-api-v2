Hey what's with the long face?
What happened?
It's fine to go at your own pace so let's hear it all
In times when things don't go your way
Or when you feel that you hate yourself
Take a rest and a deep, deep breath
I would like for you to always remember this song
Let's be happy together
With a big smile La La La La La
Overflowing with kindness! Will the message reach you?
Those small feelings
Will overlap La La La La La
One by one they'll unite
Let's connect our voices
There's no one who doesn't make mistakes!
Try not to worry about it too much, okay?
What is for tomorrow leave it for your future self, that's the way it goes
When you can't hold yourself back anymore
When you just want someone to notice your pain
Take a rest and a deep, deep breath
And I want you to sing me back this song
Even all the sad things
Wipe them with a smile La La La La
If the tears begin to overflow, let me hold your hand
Those small feelings
Will overlap La La La La La
One by one they'll unite
Let's connect our voices
When I start being kind towards you
When I start thinking about everyone around
I saw all and took deep, deep breath
And this song was the first thing that came into my mind
Let's be happy together
With a big smile La La La La La
Overflowing with kindness! Will the message reach you?
Those small feelings
Will overlap La La La La La
One by one they'll unite
Let's connect our voices
