We can kiss the sun I feel pretty good
We can kiss the sun; to the new sky
We can kiss the sun I feel pretty good
We can kiss the sun
When reality and ideals intersect
Stumbling, crying, and staring at my feet
Surely this means I won't back down
It's a sign that things are getting better
I can fly again because there's a place for me
Now is the only time I can do this
But I don't want to, Why not?!
I'll never let go of this extraordinary future
So, take my hand, let's go see it together!
Shiny Shiny Shiny Shiny wings, to a new sky
Dive Dive Dive to the new days
We'll go as far as we can, Go! Yeah!
It's either up to fate or yourself to set foot on this unexplored landscape
Shiny Shiny Shiny Shiny wings, there's infinite possibilities
Dive Dive Dive to the new days
As we are now, we'll go! Yeah!
Spreading our wings and flying so high
We can kiss the sun
We can kiss the sun I feel pretty good
We can kiss the sun
Yo, a place where we can be serious and talk all night
Stumbling along on the journey
I cherish it so much that I'm scared I'll lose it on the way
But you led me here
That smile has saved me on more than one occasion
Thank you
Now that I can accept that I'm weak
I'm not finished yet, so I'll keep going
I'll be waiting by the picturesque scenery
My heart is on stand-by, perfectly OK!
Let's see where the story goes next!
Shiny Shiny Shiny Shiny wings, to the thrilling sky
Dive Dive Dive to the new days
Spreading endlessly
Let's paint a rainbow on this unexplored frontier with our favorite colors
Shiny Shiny Shiny Shiny wings
You taught me this
Dive Dive Dive to the new days
As I am now, it's so good!
We'll fly so high until we're satisfied
We can kiss the sun
An endless blue sky
I can fly as far as I want to! A revolution is happening
Feelings bubble up inside of me
Let's take the risk and jump into a new age! New age!
Nothing needs to be guaranteed
I'm just making sure it's safe, let's fly away!
