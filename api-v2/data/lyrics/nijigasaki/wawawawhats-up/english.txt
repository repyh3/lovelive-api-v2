(Let's say) Hello!
Tell me about all your different things
Yes, if it's a miracle that we could meet,
Then probably nothing is impossible, it's so emotional
Whenever we get together, we have love and peace
A little more, over here (over here?) come closer
Pretending to be indecisive is not an option (not an option! Not an option!)
As long as you have your best smile, all right! We go!
We resonate, let's go.
Hey, all girls have their own algorithm
Let's jump up, if we fill the sky
With your rhythm,
We can fly and fly
This is a music show, overflowing
With sound of love from the heart
"I'm happy (Hey!) that I have you (Hey!)"
From which should I begin to transmit it?
Groove on heart that never stops
Let me always hear your voice
That can put words together
We can't stop shining
Because it's such a lively melody
So let's start our show!
What, what, one-two, one-two, in a circle!
What's up!
Hey, hey, pass me all your different things
You can't stop reciting
There are no problems, right? When everything starts abruptly,
No matter where, virtual and real meeting
Yes, we're always in action; so that we can feel each other better
Sneeze decisively, to make it dazzling!
Let's boil, fire up and raise a toast
All right! We go!
Let's go anywhere
Hey, all girls have their own colorful rhythm
Let's stand up, if we sing
Our prism loud,
We can run and run
This is a music show that's poured
With the sound of love that bound us
"Every day (Hey!) we have a holiday (Hey!)"
It explodes anywhere
Trembling groove on heart
Because the sky is always above us,
Smile, wherever you are, certainly
Our radiance rolls everywhere,
Because we're among those who have fun
So let's dance in our show!
What, what, one-two, one-two, in a circle!
What's up!
When we sparkle, we know
What the speed of light is
Because I'm with you (yes!)
I don't forget there's a world
That we can draw, you too, right?
This is a music show, overflowing
With sound of love from the heart
"I'm happy (Hey!) that I have you (Hey!)"
From which should I begin to transmit it?
Groove on heart that never stops
Because today will never end,
Let me always hear your voice
We can't stop shining
Because it's such a lively melody
So let's start our show!
What, what, one-two, one-two, in a circle!
What's up!
