Peace connects our hearts
Even when we're far apart
Have faith in us
(Clap your hands)
Even if you can't see it,
Our voices create a bond
You understand it so well
(Shake my hands)
Open the door - it's show time
Excitement is overflowing - love for life
Passion bursts when the tension is at its highest
Turn the volume all the way up!
I'm in perfect shape when I'm with my friends
We're going to reach the climax
One For All! All For One!
We'll play a fun game of hide-and-seek (Ready or not?)
Let's find everyone (Here I come!)
Grab the light
And dive into it
Singing as much as we like
Dancing as much as we like
Let's talk and laugh about anything
Wow Wow All night long
Until the sun shines down on us
Doing all sorts of things
Doing all kinds of things
The fun can't be stopped
Wow Wow All my love
A miracle is starting, so stay tuned!
Double the amount of joy
And half the amount of sadness
Since we're always together
(Oh my friends!)
Even if the world
Comes to an end someday,
We'll still laugh together
(For my friends!)
Suddenly, something surprising happens!
It's that one of a kind surprise
With our feelings as one, we can make rainbows bloom! We are Nijigasaki!
Overcoming those tears is a part of growing up!!
Being with your friends is what we call youth
Don't Think! Feel!
Dream Come True
We'll play a fun game of catch-the-ball (Oh for your smile)
Let's this game last forever (Oh nice ball)
Embrace the future
And take flight
Hold out both of your hands
And let our eyes meet
Make some noise for our sympathy
Wow Wow All night long
Let's take a detour on our way home
Even bigger than the sky
Is our rhapsody that wraps around
Your big heart
Wow Wow All my love
A miracle is something like this, so stay tuned!
More excitement awaits me
Than I can count on my two hands
Soon, this love of mine will burst
Surprise!
Singing as much as we like
Dancing as much as we like
Let's talk and laugh about anything
Wow Wow All night long
Until the sun shines down on us
Doing all sorts of things
Doing all kinds of things
The fun can't be stopped
Wow Wow All my love
A miracle is starting, so stay tuned!
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Wow Wow
Yeah Yeah Yeah
