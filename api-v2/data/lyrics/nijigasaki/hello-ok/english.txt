Hello OK?? Are you having trouble?
Let me show you the way
It's kind of strange, this encounter of ours
Is making my heart race
Even Lady Liberty's smile shines upon
This ultra-class destiny
Delivering a radiant smile,
Shining bright for everyone
From Asakusa's charm to Tokyo Tower's glow
Let's chase the night to the Rainbow Bridge
When my heart and your heart begin to connect,
The distance between us slowly fades away
If it's words that can't get through to you,
Then let's just break down that wall
You and I being born on the same Earth
Was a blessing meant for me from God
You're my treasured, treasured present,
Turning these ordinary days into something colorful
The threads that crossed paths are connecting
Very Happy, overflowing with happiness
And people all around
Everyone's precious smiles
Make my heart dance with joy
When my heart and your heart begin to overlap,
They open-up, expand, and create a story
Even if many years pass us by,
We'll always remember these memories, right?
If you and I could feel the same way,
It would be like a blessing sent to me from God
These treasured moments of mine are
Turning these ordinary days into something colorful
The miracle that descended upon me returns to the night sky
The time we spent together is etched into my heart
I'll never forget it, wrapped in this warmth
Even if words that can't get through to you,
As long as we always stay by each other's side
A rainbow-colored world unfolds,
Moving forward into a very lovely Special Day
May these soaring feelings
Echo into a radiant tomorrow
If it's words that can't get through to you,
Then let's just break down that wall
You and I being born on the same Earth is wonderful
It's a blessing meant for me from God
You're my treasured, treasured present,
Turning these ordinary days into something colorful
The threads that crossed paths are connecting
