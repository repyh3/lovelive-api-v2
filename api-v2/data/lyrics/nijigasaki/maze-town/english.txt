"Audistisne de illa?
Dominus, qui venit.
Ab hinc non effugiet..."
Even tonight, the moonlight glares into the darkness
The clock's hands tremble at midnight
I can see that you've arrived. Hiding behind that heavy door,
Waiting for the right moment
We'll always be connected
But there's no forever
Who decided that?
Let's believe we can jump over time and life
There's no escaping this Maze Town Maze Town
Many souls continue to wander
I have protected them
Through thousands of years of wind and rain
Maze Town, no matter how dark this place is
We'll continue to move forward into a future that we have yet to see
So that these precious things aren't broken
I listen to the sound of footsteps
Who, who, who is there?
We'll let you know this is where we live
By emitting an eerie sound from within the mirror
Seeing a moving shadow that shouldn't be there
Only eerie silhouettes can be seen
Things that never change
Can't be destroyed
From the past to the future
What I thought I believed in remains in my heart
I can't leave this Maze Town Maze Town
My memories and this place continue to spin
Because I will protect
The time and memories I carved
Maze Town goes beyond this neverending night
Now these revived souls are left to wander
My boundaries are vaguely fading away
Listening to my heart and having a look around
Who is standing beside me?
"Et ego servabo te...
Dum per tenebrae.
Nunc autem venit tempus!"
Shall we dance?
Let's continue to dance with me forever
Spinning around and around, I continue to go beyond time
I'm the same as always, no matter what day it is
I have protected what I wanted to protect
Now, now, I'm moving
There's no escaping this Maze Town Maze Town
Many souls continue to wander
I have protected them
Through thousands of years of wind and rain
Maze Town, no matter how dark this place is
We'll continue to move forward into a future that we have yet to see
So that these precious things aren't broken
I listen to the sound of footsteps
Who, who, who is there?
