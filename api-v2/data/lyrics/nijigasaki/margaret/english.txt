I look in the mirror and ask myself:
"As who I am right now, do I look adorable?"
I still haven't received an answer yet
So that I can keep up even more smiles than anybody else
I have to be the cutest I can be today, too
Thinking about it all alone in my room
Although this is my true face
Could you like it even more?
Please listen!
I want you to see me when I'm sad and happy
Even the strange faces I have sometimes, please laugh them off and forgive them
Because you've always cared for me
I want to be number one for you
I've put all my feelings into this song
And will continue to work
Even harder for you
Just like a balloon I feel my head starts to swell up
I feel I can't stop myself from trembling all over
It's nothing like me don't you think?
It's the first time I feel like that
My chest ever so slightly feels tight
Please listen!
Even if I told you everything about me please don't ever part ways with me
I've come to get something I love more
Than everything I've cherished before
I'm so sorry for making you see me
Hidden this much behind a veil
But by all and any means I want to connect with you
With this Special Margaret
Please listen!
I want you to see me when I'm sad and happy
Even the strange faces I have sometimes, please laugh them off and forgive them
Because you've always cared for me
I want to be number one for you
I've put all my feelings into this song
And will continue to work
Even harder for you
