I want to see it with you,
Whatever the view is
It's like a drama
Of 365 different days
The warm scent of the cherry blossoms,
The brilliant sun, and a splash of water
Those red and yellow mountains
And even the snow and illuminations
Time flies when I spent time with you
Look, the seasons are flying by
It's an endless cycle
It won't stop, it won't stop!
I don't want it to stop
We'll make the future as a story which was written by us
Even our tears
Will go for a run
Because let's have fun, be excited, and float with joy
These memories continue to shine brightly in the 4 SEASONS
The days I've spent with you
Were colorful every single day
Yes, I won't forget it
Even in this very moment
Meeting, farewells, and blooming
Wearing colorful yukatas, playing with sparklers
Those pumpkin ghosts,
And a winter triangle
Time flies when I spent time with you
Look, the seasons are flying by
I will weave my way to the future
It won't stop, it won't stop!
I don't want it to stop
We make the dream as many times as we want
Lalala Lalala Lalala Lalala
Lalala Lalala Lalala La
A fantasy that interweaves with the four seasons
May they always watch over us
You can always feel them
Standing right next to you
Time flies when I spent time with you
Look, the seasons are flying by
It's an endless cycle
It won't stop, it won't stop!
I don't want it to stop
We'll make the future as a story which was written by us
Even our tears
Will go for a run
Because let's have fun, be excited, and float with joy
These memories continue to shine brightly in the 4 SEASONS
Lalala Lalala Lalala Lalala
Lalala Lalala Lalala La
