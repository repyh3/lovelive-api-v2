La la la love
Love is always kind and thoughtful
The best kind of hospitality is saying
"Good morning♪" from the bottom of your heart
Just seeing that smile
Is enough to make me do my best everyday
Not being able to do it feels a little bittersweet
But when you are tired or sad again...
I want to support you! Love for you (for you!!)
I want to heal you! Love is true (is true!!)
I'm always so happy when you get excited for me! (my wish)
Like a flower accompanying you in your daily life,
I want to stay here and watch over you with kindness
"Is this love?!"
Love! la love! Sweet sweetie love!
Na na na now
This distance isn't too close or too far away
There's no time to lose, I got to do it now!
But for some reason, I don't have the courage to do so!
My thoughts are stuck on cloud nine
You're all I think about everyday
You feel a little overwhelmed from time to time
So I'll perform a little spell to cheer you up☆
I want to give you something! Smile for you (for you!!)
My smile is true (is true!!)
Even now, it makes me happy when my hearts flutters with excitement! (my wish)
Like a light illuminating you in your daily life,
I want to gently nurture this moment with you
You're special to me, even if I can't put my feelings into words
But I've always held onto these hidden true feelings of mine
I want to support you! Love for you (for you!!)
I want to heal you! Love is true (is true!!)
I'm always so happy when you get excited for me! (my wish)
Like a flower accompanying you in your daily life,
I want to stay here and watch over you with kindness
"This is love!"
Love! la love! Sweet sweetie love!
