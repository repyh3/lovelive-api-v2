Fu Fu Fuwa Fu Fu so soft
Ready, set...let's take one together:
A lively bath time!
My favorite bath-bomb
Has such a nice scent.
I'm going to blast you with a cold shower.
That's not nice! Let's all get along.
This shampoo is good at making my hair feel silky smooth.
So glossy...let me use it as well!
Fuwa Fuwa Fuwa hour!
Surrounded by its gentle embrace.
I can't help but smile
In this warm environment.
Our hearts are Fuwa Fuwa. Our bodies are Awa Awa.
I want this moment to last forever.
This bath is Fuwa Fuwa. Oh-la-la, Awa Awa.
Try to not get too dizzy.
Forget about the time;
Let's enjoy our bath time.
We'll finger paint on the mirror;
Doesn't my bear look so cute?
I feel so good so I'm going to fall asleep.
Don't go to sleep here! Go to bed when you get out.
My most valued bath salts will
Make sure your skin stays in top-notch condition!
Fuwa Fuwa Fuwa hour!
Humming a melody;
Before you know it, we're all singing along.
Happiness surrounds us.
Our hearts are Waku Waku. The steam is Yura Yura.
We smile whenever our eyes meet.
This bath is Waku Waku. Oh-la-la, Yura Yura.
Try not to slip and hurt yourself!
I have to get up early to finish my homework.
But, for now, forget everything and take a bath!
An hour of beauty♡
Fuwa Fuwa Fuwa hour!
