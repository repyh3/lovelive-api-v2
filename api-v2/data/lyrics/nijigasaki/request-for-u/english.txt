What I want to do with you, what I want to see with you
I hope for too much, this is such is greedy love!
No matter how insignificant the event, tell me about it first
The one, who apologizes first after a quarrel, wins!
Listen, every time our eyes meet, let's make funny faces, to make each other laugh
If I win, buy me my favorite juice
The reason I constantly request something from you is because I love you
This is honest love, please, take care of me like this!
Love is the spice of everyday life! If you join, it will definitely be fun
I want to scream about this great love! Please, take it as it's due
Let's come up with nicknames just for the two of us! Let's find an original image
That we'll laugh at every time we call each other. I won't stop pestering you with requests!
What I want to do with you, what I want to see with you
I hope for too much, this is such is greedy love!
People around me tend to think I'm strong, but this also makes me worried
At such moments don't say anything, just hold me tightly
The day we met, the day we fell in love, let's make them our memorable dates
If you ever forget about them, be prepared to be punished!
Although I constantly request something from you, isn't all this proof that I love you?
Is it a little heavy? Nothing like that! So I'm counting on you!
First of all smile is the style of this love. If we continue, we will definitely be happy
This great love moves me to the tears! Let's connect forever
Let's expect great things from each other! Let's enjoy a special time just for the two of us
When we smile at random moments. Hey, isn't this wonderful? I have a request for you!
Even on days, when nothing happens, the brightly sparkling magic of love
Is all that you and I have! By holding hands tightly, let's go to the future
"Let's continue to be together! Just kidding!"
Love is the spice of everyday life! If you join, it will definitely be fun
I want to scream about this great love! Please, take it as it's due
Let's come up with nicknames just for the two of us. Let's find an original image
That we'll laugh at every time we call each other. I won't stop pestering you with requests!
