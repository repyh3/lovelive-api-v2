I never want to forget
The scenery that we saw together
Words like that suddenly float up in my mind
I won't let go, I'll hold your hand tightly (tightly)
I want to find more and more things I can do,
There must be something, right?
Let the shape of our dream expand. Will tomorrow have a different shape?
I'm telling you, "I love you", so please accept it
You are changing more and more
I don't want to lose (because I always, always want to see you)
Let's run through today!
It's like we're running through time and overtaking it
With this momentum, we can go anywhere
A story born from the spark in our hearts
There's more... to come! It's not over quite yet
Let's make this song our promise
It will connect us even if we're far apart
Ah, I'm always feeling this love for you
Because, because, in the course of my daily life,
I discovered the meaning of our meeting (things like that)
That means we can talk about our dreams and hopes
A smile that shows you're trying your best is the strongest
Then that means you're the super-super-super strongest
I can't afford to lose (that's why, that's why I want to see you)
Let's keep on running!
Time doesn't stop, and neither do our dreams
You know, with this momentum, we can go anywhere
A story that flew towards something wonderful
I want to aim for the next sky again
Let's make this song our promise
Our hearts are connected through our song
Ah, please send your feelings anytime
I wonder when it started, even when I'm alone
Something, something bright and warm keeps welling up, welling up in my chest
A bittersweet, burning heartbeat
It's like we're running through time and overtaking it
With this momentum, we can go anywhere
A story born from the spark in our hearts
There's more... to come! It's not over quite yet
Let's make this song our promise
It will connect us even if we're far apart
Ah, I'm always feeling this love for you
Let's make this song our promise
