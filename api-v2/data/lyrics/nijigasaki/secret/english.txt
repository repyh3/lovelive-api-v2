The clear March sky shines overhead
With a shade of blue that looks just a little lonely
Then, in an instant our eyes meet,
And my heartbeat does a little jump
As I admire your side profile in quiet admiration
While savoring this moment of happiness, I burst into a big smile
As the wind blows, my skirt dances like it's on waves
Concealing the emotions that waver from inside me
Just for this moment, I want to be the only one you see
Silhouettes line up against the dazzling display window
Reflecting back what's truly in my heart
As long as no one else notices, I'm fine keeping it a secret
My fluttering white blouse
Reflects the excitement in the air
Holding back the words
That are about to spill over
As if signaling the end of a dream
The Statue of Liberty stood as the water's surface gleamed in rainbow light
Our steps had aligned as we walked together
Then little by little, we began to fall out of sync
But, even so, just for this moment, I want you all to myself
Is this selfish of me? Even so, I don't care
Let me stay, even if only for one more second
Before the cherry blossom buds come and take you away from me
I understand
Just how important your future is to you
I want to protect you
I want to love you
It's not enough... "I need more..." "always..."
But I can't bring myself to say it
As the wind blows, my skirt dances like it's on waves
Concealing the emotions that waver from inside me
Just for this moment, I want to be the only one you see
The time we share, laughing side by side
Have become precious and irreplaceable moments
Softly embracing this treasure that's become mine alone in my heart
I'm fine keeping it a secret
