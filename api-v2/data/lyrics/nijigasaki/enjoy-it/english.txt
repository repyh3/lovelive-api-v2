Alright! It's going to be okay
You can rely on me every once in a while, OK!
The wind passed through us
And we heard a pleasant rhythm
This world is so big
It's a miracle that we were able to meet
Be yourself, all of our various shapes
Made me realize that
Even if the light is shut out, our colors keep changing
We couldn't see this panorama on our own
It's almost like a prism!
Let's enjoy our life together
With our whole bodies☆
Shake it! Shake it! Shake it! Move to the rhythm
Colorful, make it! Make it! Just like you want it
It's almost blinding how dazzling this harmony of our voices is
As many times as you want, shake it! Shake it! Shake it!
The world is amazing
Let's make it! Make it! Make it!
We're playing freely, let's all have fun☆
The excitement just won't stop in my heartbeat
Just fine! No need to worry
You don't have to think about it, OK!
Hey listen, listen closely
This feeling we've never felt before is so wonderful
Our colors blend together
This is the first scenery we've painted
Be yourself, all of our various feelings
Took us down this path
Even a depressed heart can be glamorous
We couldn't reach this drama on our own
It's almost like a kaleidoscope
Let's enjoy our music together
All around the world☆
Shake it! Shake it! Shake it! Holding hands
Burst it, Make it! Make it! During this fun melody
Our voices harmonize together
Our swelling chemistry cannot be stopped, oh!
Because we're together, new possibilities open up before our very eyes.
There's no need for such difficult words!
With our whole bodies☆
Shake it! Shake it! Shake it! Move to the rhythm
Colorful, make it! Make it! Just like you want it
It's almost blinding how dazzling this harmony of our voices is
As many times as you want, shake it! Shake it! Shake it!
The world is amazing
Let's make it! Make it! Make it!
We're playing freely, let's all have fun☆
The excitement just won't stop in my heartbeat
