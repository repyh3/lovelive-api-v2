C-c-c-conveying my feelings is really hard
But I'll do my very very very best to reach you
I-i-i-i-it doesn't really show on my face
But joy and anger, grief and pleasure, all those emotions
Make my heart race recklessly ba-dump ba-dump, pipo papo
When the day comes that I can show you my face
I want to be there smiling
I'm sending my feelings on radio waves, be-be-be-be-beam
A network of hearts connecting me with you
My tremors won't stop, my heart's throbbing cheerfully
It's because you're here that I can be honest too
It's sparkling and shining, I'm waiting on that stage
No matter who I am, I'll be just as I am
And jump out into this new world
I-I-I I want to show you how much fun I have dancing
In my song too I'll do my very very best, I want to convey those feelings
E-e-e-even if it's not going well now, and I'm stumbling through,
I'm diligently practicing every day
Until the moment I get it perfect, my heart beats ba-dump ba-dump pipo papo
If I can someday become a wonderful person
I want to always be shining
Wire up those radio waves, be-be-be-be-beam
A communicator connecting me with you
R-I-N-A-C-H-A-N B-O-A-R-D Rina-chan board
R-I-N-A-C-H-A-N B-O-A-R-D Rina-chan board
Thank you, everyone!
No matter what difficulties come
I'll face them and overcome them
The courage to not give up goes pipo papo
One day, one day, one day, when I can show you my face
I want to be there smiling
I'm sending my feelings on radio waves, be-be-be-be-beam
A network of hearts connecting me with you
No matter when, forever, and always
I won't forget this joy
It's as though my heart is in analog, pe-pe-pe-pe-peace
It'll spread and be accessed everywhere, this miracle
My tremors won't stop, my heart's throbbing cheerfully
It's because you're here that I can be honest too
It's sparkling and shining, I'm waiting on that stage
No matter who I am, I'll be just as I am
And jump out into this new world
