Bitter sweet one-sided love, that's how it always begins
A form like a miracle, it's something you can't recognize
Since when did I become this much of a coward?
I've been deceiving the feelings that have sprouted
My heart was beating fast, and every time I saw you
I'd get myself all carried away
I want to know more
But it always ends up being a waste of time
All day long, I think of you
I'm keeping it hidden, unable to say it to you
Even I don't know what I should do
The truth is, I simply...
I want you, I need you, I miss you, I love you
Baby I, baby I, baby I, baby I...
Think of you
My heart is crying out to you
These overflowing feelings are a cosmic blue
It's like I'm floating in the air
I want you, I need you, I miss you, I love you
Baby I, baby I, baby I, baby I...
I usually show myself to be strong
But my heart is leading me to jump right in
I'm confused when take off my armor
I feel weak, almost weightless
Even the distance between us feels dear
If these are truly my honest feelings
Maybe I'll gather my courage
And try putting them into words
Before I know it, once again I think of you
It's scary how much I'm in love with you
You don't know you take me to the moon
It'll put it into words:
I want you, I need you, I miss you, I love you
Baby I, baby I, baby I, baby I...
Think of you
I'm still crazy about you
Now, what about you?
I hope you feel the same
I want you, I need you, I miss you, I love you
Baby I, baby I, baby I, baby I...
I'm so in love with you
I just want to tell you
I'm so in love with you
I need to tell you right now
