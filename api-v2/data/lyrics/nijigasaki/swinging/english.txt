It's been a while since the sky was blue, and I didn't even notice
Is it because there was too much going on?
It's the sign of a laid-back season.
Because you were here, I noticed the tone of the wind, and how our hearts are changing
I waver about in
These unsteady, uncertain days
But y'know, today I'm...
Swinging Swinging Swinging & Jump Up!
Even though I can't see what's coming right now
Future comes up! Because my heart's waiting
I'll go on a journey towards tomorrow with you (I want to tell you)
I softly sing these dearest melodies with you
Singing Singing Singing & Jump Up!
We're acting just like children
Gonna hold up! Let's stretch our arms out
And that's why I always want to be (next to you) in our own colors
Swinging Swinging Swinging My Love!
There things that I can't say, and things that I want to say
It doesn't matter what day it is
I want to tell you them, so I'm a bit troubled
Even if we're washed away
By the flow of time
Let's hold hands and walk onward
Swinging Swinging Swinging & Jump Up!
On days that you're lost
C'mon, look up! Your heart is still certain
I'll do this many times over with you (I want to reach you)
Our finest harmonies echo endlessly with you
Singing Singing Singing & Jump Up!
While strengthening our bonds,
I'll catch up to you again! I'll hug you, and not let go
And that's why I always want to be (by your side) as we look at the smiling flowers
Swinging Swinging Swinging My Love!
B'cuz... I'm just lovin' you...
There's still so much about you that I don't know
But y'know, that's okay
Swinging Swinging Swinging & Jump Up!
Even though I can't see what's coming right now
Future comes up! Because my heart's waiting
I'll go on a journey towards tomorrow with you (I want to tell you)
I softly sing these dearest melodies with you
Singing Singing Singing & Jump Up!
We're acting just like children
Gonna hold up! Let's stretch our arms out
And that's why I always want to be (next to you) in our own colors
Swinging Swinging Swinging My Love!
