I'll never forget the day we met
Before I knew it, I was heading straight ahead
If you look closely, you can see that
The joy and excitement haven't changed
This feeling is something that won't be defeated by anyone
Even if no one sees, I'll keep moving forward! Even if I'm alone
It's not just a feeling, I'm almost certain that it's much more
Hey, you want to see what it is too, don't you?
Is your heart ready to go, OK?
Now! Lock・on!
Fire away, shooter!
To a map of certainty, drawn by dreams and determination
It doesn't matter when or where,
I'll always look forward to the sky of the future
I'm here so I can keep making that smile
Again and again, just for you
After all, I am a dream☆shooter
Even if you're lost, there's no need to worry
The answer will always be waiting for you
All the time, even on my days off,
I keep refining my goals that I dream of
Even things I can't do instantly - I'll take them on, one by one
Overcome and move forward again - step by step, with certainty!
Above all else, I want to understand this excitement inside me
Yes, I can't truly know unless I share this dream with you
Just keep following me, my way!
Say! Lock・on!
Charge ahead, shooter!
Power and courage mysteriously well up inside
After all,
Because you're here, I won't ever lose my way
I can't put it into words,
But I just know that I can make my dreams come true
After all, I am a dream☆shooter
Now! Lock・on!
Fire away, shooter!
To a map of certainty, drawn by dreams and determination
It doesn't matter when or where,
I'll always look forward to the sky of the future
I'm here so I can keep making that smile
Again and again, just for you
After all, I am a dream☆shooter
