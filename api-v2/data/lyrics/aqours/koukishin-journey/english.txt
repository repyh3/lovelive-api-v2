Curiosity journey
With my own eyes, I want to see everything I find interesting
When you let yourself go, every day goes by in the blink of an eye
Tell me now, tell me now about you
Me? The fairies? What do you to know about? (About what?)
Is it okay? (Is it okay?) Let me hear you talk about both!
But in return you have to tell something about you
(It's a bit embarrassing)
There's nothing to hide!
(We're both in this together)
This will stay between us (Ready!)
It's strange
The more I talk about myself, the more aware I become of who I am
My nervousness turns into excitement
The world seems to shine brighter!
It's wonderful
Let me help you on your journey of discovery
What is that? What is this? I was wondering...
Let's share our excitement on this
Curiosity journey

Curiosity journey
There's a great power hidden in this little body
I'll show you, leave it to me! I hope I can be of help
Tell me now, tell me now what I can do
Go to the city and ask questions to find out (Goin')
It's good! (It's good!) I have the energy of a hundred horsepower!
So far, I've been working so hard on my own
(But not anymore)
I'm full of joy
(You can always count on me)
Well then, let's do the best we can!
Even if it's a long and hard road, even if I'm not recognized
I'll keep believing that someday I can be of help to someone
(Ready!)
It's amazing
That despite all the problems, I can be so happy
You have helped me a lot, so thank you
My heart feels excited too!
It's wonderful
I'm enjoying searching for the unknown on this journey of discovery
What is that? What is this? I was wondering...
