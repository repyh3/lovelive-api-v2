Po-Po-Pop! I've been waiting, and waiting for you
Po-Po-Pop! I won't leave you for the rest of the day
Po-Po-Pop! Popping Party, Everybody dance!
Pop open, Party Party, pop?
Pop open, Party Party!!
How about we say "nice to meet you" a bunch of times?
Even though we always see each other, So, Popping Party!
We can meet up and act like everything's fresh and new between us
So tonight, we're all going to be pumped up
And dance for as long as we want
More, more, more, more?
We're gonna dance for as long as we want. Woo... O.K.!!
It's strange that we get along so well
But we're still in a, Ah!! Good mood
If you're feeling happy, let's dance til dawn
Jump (all together now), jump (all together now)
Jump and you'll understand
Days seem shorter when you're having fun, smiling ear to ear
Let's think about tomorrow when tomorrow comes
We’ve got a moment straight out of our dreams, right here
Pop open, Party Party, pop?
Pop open, Party Party!!
You'll be fine even though you're shy - so am I
To be honest, I'm also a Shy heart! So, too shy my heart!
I want to go crazy all night
That I completely forget about it
We're gonna dance for as long as we want
More, more, more, more?
Gonna dance for as long as we want. Woo... O.K.!!
I see a smile on your face, and before I know it
You're shouting really loudly, Ah!! We're in a good mood
If you're feeling lonely, let's dance til dawn
Jump (all together now), jump (all together now)
Jump and you'll understand
All I want to do is have a good time
Let's dance our gloom away
It's like our worries rolled off us with all the sweat we worked up, and our bodies are lighter now
Don't say time flies
When you're having fun just yet
I don't want to go home, and you don't have to either
We've got a moment straight out of our dreams, right here
Po-Po-Pop!
We're gonna dance, Po-Po-Pop! As long as we want
Po-Po-Pop!

All I want to do is have a good time
Let's dance our gloom away
It's like our worries rolled off us with all the sweat we worked up, and our bodies are lighter now
Don't say time flies
When you're having fun just yet
I don't want to go home, and you don't have to either
We've got a moment straight out of our dreams, right here
