We've always talked about our dreams
But where will we go from this moment on out?
There's a view that changes and feelings that never change
As I silently stare at the sea
I remember the time we first met
The days sure have passed me by
But that's okay,
'Cause I'm smiling more than ever now
My heart is always singing
As I want to shine
And if I were to lose my way, I'll start all over again
Dreams have multiple meanings
But where will I go? Or, where will we go?
Listening to the waves wash away the sand
Means that I know the answer is in my heart
I remember those important to me
And those precious days, too
It's okay, I won't forget them at all
My heart is always singing
As I want to shine
And if I were to lose my way, I'll start all over again
Waves, Sounds, Refrain
