Hey, what comes after this? I'm hooked
Oh, what to do? I'm starting to fidget with impatience
My curiosity, curiosity abounds!
This is a forbidden story, a love story I want to know more about
Away from prying eyes, corruption blossoms from outstretched hands
I want to learn how love begins, my heart pounds in anticipation
First, when two people's eyes meet, comes that spark between them
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes!! Isn't the right word for this
I want to meet my lover so badly I could cry,
But I'm only at the entrance to this tower
Where will I arrive, after I climb that spiral tower?
My imagination's running wild, my heart's about to melt
I'm dreaming of secrets here in this spiral tower of love
I want these forbidden stories
To set my heart aflutter
I'll search for that excitement
And I won't stop!
That's right, I won't be satisfied with this hazy ambiguousness
After all, our feelings are already this entangled,
A pain that has already been fated
When love starts, so does the countdown to the end
No! Stop the clock!
I'll open the door to my fantasies, getting closer to eternity
Yes, yes, yes! Let me hear your "yes!!"
Even though this is so clear in my mind,
It's all a fictional tale
Is the spiral tower just the embodiment of my desire?
If that's the case, then I want to see an even freer form of love
This spiral tower's my secret dream after all
There's a thrill running down my spine
I'm a bit frightened at this wondrous tale
But these feelings aren't bad, so I sweetly sigh
Ah! How far up these steps will I climb, towards a infinite fantasy
Ah! I've fallen in love with love, I'm secretly imagining an innocent, feverish story
I want to learn how love begins, my heart pounds in anticipation
First, when two people's eyes meet, they're connected by that spark
And then a passionate, fervent sigh!
I want to meet my lover so badly I could cry,
But I'm only at the entrance to this tower
Where will I arrive, after I climb that spiral tower?
My imagination's running wild, my heart's about to melt
I'm dreaming of secrets here in this spiral tower of love
I want these forbidden stories
To set my heart aflutter
I'll search for that excitement
And I won't stop!
