I woke up early (Happy!)
It's forecast to be sunny all day (Lucky!)
You're putting on that overly impressed face again
Well then, maybe I should try doing this every day from now on... just kidding
Like always (like always) it's best when things are like this, right?
I mess up and get discouraged (but it's okay)
These worries never seem to end
Even so, if we stick together,
Naturally (naturally) our hearts will begin to clear up
My buddy, stay by my side forever
Let's treasure even the little, silly moments
We laugh and cry in the very same place
Because together, we're one and the same
Even an ordinary day
Becomes special if I'm with you
Happy, Lucky. Let's keep stacking those moments, and keep smiling together
The house is squeaky clean (Happy!)
And the futon is aired out! (Good job, me!)
As long as we're holding hands, it'll be a piece of cake, right?
I was thinking that before we go shopping,
We could take a little detour
Sounds good, right? (Sounds good!) Then it's decided!
Let's head out!
I snuggle into that soft, fluffy body, and gently fall asleep...
Hey, hold up! What are you doing?! We've still got so much left to do!
My buddy, when something gets you down
And you're feeling low, just lean on me
Even without saying it out loud, I understand,
Because the two of us are one
Just hold me close and don't let go,
Let's grow more and more gentle feelings together
Let's keep piling up our "thank yous" and walk forward together
Even if the world were completely different,
I still feel like we'd be together
We're connected deep, so very deep,
Because the two of us are one
Even an ordinary day
Becomes special if I'm with you
Happy, Lucky. Let's keep stacking those moments, and keep smiling together
Let's stay together, just the two of us
So... it's a promise, 'kay?
