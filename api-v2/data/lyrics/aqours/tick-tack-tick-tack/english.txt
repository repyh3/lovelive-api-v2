La la la. La la la la la
Welcome back. I'm home.
I'm so embarrassed and ashamed,
I involuntarily begin to be stubborn, forgive me.
Seeing that you haven't changed at all,
I actually felt secretly relieved.
These are, these are very dear memories to me.
Let's start right now
The time, which then stopped.
Tick-tack, tick-tack,
It starts to move.
Having placed the courage suddenly blossomed in me into the wind,
I'm calling you, calling you with all my might.
Step by step my soul is becoming easier,
(Tick-tack) Tick-tack (Tick-tack)
I'm getting closer to you.
Admiring you, who alone
Goes towards your dream, holding on to it,
I myself found what I like.
Now, you know, I'm so happy!
This is, this is a nostalgic feeling in its own way.
The smell of the forest and the open sky,
I don't like it, don't like it or maybe I like it.
Let's surrender,
Tick-tack, tick-tack,
To the rhythm of this city.
La la la. La la la la la
Welcome back. I'm home.
The feelings stuck in my chest
Are gradually taking shape.
Thank you, thank you —
That's what I wanted to tell you.
It's already late? This cannot be!
As it should, as it should looking eye to eye,
Let's say it bluntly.
When the setting sun stretches our shadows,
Although it's just one word,
But I'll overcome myself, who wants to escape,
And certainly deliver it to you.
Like I've been waiting for this moment,
Having placed the courage suddenly blossomed in me into the wind,
I'm calling you, calling you with all my might.
Step by step my soul is becoming easier,
(Tick-tack) Tick-tack (Tick-tack)
I'm getting closer to you.
With you, with you I finally smile again.
La-la-la… Let's have fun!
La-la-la… Smile again.
"Yohane-chan, welcome back."
"I'm home"
