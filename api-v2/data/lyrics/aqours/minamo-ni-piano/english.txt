I noticed my heart has been changing since that moment
I stared at the waves, hoping to become stronger
What can I do?
I'm know I'm small but I want to run as fast as I can
I'm still chasing after a precious dream
I believe our feelings are one, even in the faraway future
The sound of the waves in my heart are becoming a new song
I'll keep playing a song about our beloved story
This song will be spread far and wide with our voices
It will be heard from miles away
When you started to feel deep sorrow at that time
I wanted to protect you...more than you wanted me to
I'm almost at breaking point, I want to scream
A me who I don't know? Nice to meet you!
I'm always following my own heart
Our feelings are one
I'll always believe in those important to me
Our feelings are one; I won't give up on the future
A blue heart is warming up and becoming a new dream
I won't let our beloved story end just yet
This song is our song; it connects us from far and wide
It will be heard from miles away
I want to see the light at the end of the horizon
A world where the sky and the sea become one
I imagine a piano floating on the water's surface, playing a song
Let's all sing together forever and ever
The sound of the waves in my heart are becoming a new song
I'll keep playing a song about our beloved story
This song will be spread far and wide with our voices
It will be heard from miles and miles away
A blue heart is warming up and becoming a new dream
I won't let our beloved story end just yet
This song is our song; it connects us from far and wide
It will be heard from miles away
