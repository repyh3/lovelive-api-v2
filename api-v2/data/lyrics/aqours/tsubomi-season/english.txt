Drifting apart towards the distance
Although I know this is not good-bye
But I don't know why I still feel so lonely
A sigh falls through the gap between my fingers
The sadness that blooms everyday
I finally found it
Ah, I want to convey it. Did I convey it to you?
I just want to stay by your side some more
I selfishly think to myself
I hope we stay together like this forever
I just want to stay by your side some more
But I can't just stand around and do nothing
The passing seasons also have their own meanings
The next bud is swaying in the sunlight
If there's a future that I want to see bloom,
Then I won't be discouraged by the wind and the rain
What can I do?
I need to check up on myself
Ah, let's move on from here
Because I still have so many dreams
I got to make sure they all come true
Somewhere along the way, I realized I really wanted them to come true
Because I still have so many dreams
There's no time to be standing around
Those buds will open up their petals someday!
It's strange how people meet
We're happy at first, then gradually becoming more familiar with each other
And now.... now...
I just want to stay by your side some more
My heart yearns to be close to you
I hope we stay together like this forever
I just want to stay by your side some more
My heart yearned to be close to you
But the passing seasons also have their own meanings
The next bud is swaying in the sunlight
