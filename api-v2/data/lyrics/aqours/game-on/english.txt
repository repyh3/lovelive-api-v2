Ah Check it, check it ah
GAME ON!
Oh, oh, pa-pa-pa-parallel, GAME ON!
Oh, oh, pa-pa-pa-parallel, GAME ON!
Whispering in your ear, Devil or Angel?
Approaching choices, On your mark
This or that? Who is the real me?
Sure, I'll answer you
We can't stop
Exploring this world of dreams
The reason is unknown
New world, new world
Let's have some fun
When the signal starts to resonate, the kaleidoscope will spin
How about you? Are you getting dizzy
From this dazzling scene?
When I close my eyes, the battle begins
Voices overlap
GAME ON NOW!
Still, the spiral staircase continues
Climbing, descending, where are we?
This or that? Curious questions
We can go further
Is this not a dream?
Even if you ask, I'll pretend not to know
Towards the mysterious future
Don't stop, don't stop
Let's run ahead
If we dance together, the kaleidoscope will turn
How about you? A rendezvous
Glistening brightly
The battle to find our hopes
Voices overlap
GAME ON NOW!
Under any sky, and even the sea
We're connected
Because I'm by your side
In this mysterious world
We'll sing together
When the signal starts to resonate, the kaleidoscope will spin
How about you? Are you getting dizzy
From this dazzling scene?
When I close my eyes, the battle begins
Voices overlap
GAME ON NOW!
Oh, oh, pa-pa-pa-parallel, GAME ON!
Oh, oh, pa-pa-pa-parallel, GAME ON!
