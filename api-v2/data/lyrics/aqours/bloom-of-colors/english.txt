Many different events color our present
They apply their colors to the one canvas over and over again
Yesterday it was yesterday's color
And tomorrow it will be tomorrow's color
Now I have learned to enjoy change
Of course, not only good things happen
Maybe we even have more difficulties
However I will move on, looking forward,
Step by step, carrying your memories
And today we, who live for today (since this is us)
Let's make all kinds of colors bloom
Naturally, they will bloom even in the future (come on)
I feel like something new is about to begin! (It begins)
There is nothing to be afraid of anymore (it's okay)
I have all of you, irreplaceable to me (irreplaceable)
And you're with us too!
Deep in my heart they never fade
BLOOM OF COLORS
Thinking that I had to be persistent, I unwittingly rushed and wasted my time
What would you say in such a situation? I'm trying to imagine it
Let's chat, while swimming in a sea of memories
Everything changes, but let's stay the same
Of course, even if we let go of our hands, we'll still feel close to each other
Right? We're connected by our hearts
There is no reason to worry
And today we, who live for today (since this is us)
Let's play the melody of promise
Our singing always spreads into the distance (come on)
It can make this world a kinder place (kinder)
There is nothing to be afraid of anymore (it's okay)
I have all of you, irreplaceable to me (irreplaceable)
And you're with us too!
Deep in my heart they never fade
BLOOM OF COLORS
(Unite our voices) we are together
(Together) forever and ever
(Unite our voices) let's put our colors together
(Together)
BLOOM OF COLORS
