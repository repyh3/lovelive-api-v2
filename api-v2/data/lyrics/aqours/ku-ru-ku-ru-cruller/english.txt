The sky and the sea
Are always connected (with you)
We'll always be able to meet
Inside of your heart
Now, if you close your eyes
Our stage will appear
Let's dance with me
In the world that we jumped into, our dreams will spin round and round!
What'll happen?
As long as we have a blast, it'll be alright!
We'll make you happy in this new way
I know that we feel the same
I always know
I understand what your feelings are
Singing to the sky,
And talking to the sea (even now)
I'll always be listening
To what you're saying
Yes, it doesn't end when you open your eyes
Our stage is an
Endless passion
In these overlapping worlds, our dreams will spin round and round!
What'll happen?
I want to play with you forever and ever
Hearing your voice from afar makes me feel happy
We feel the same way
I understand what you're wishing for
I want to always be with you
There's a place that connects me to you
From your heart to mine, our connected sounds won't be erased
I believe it'll be conveyed to you
My love will be conveyed (my love!)
My desire to make you happy
Is something that won't ever change
I was lucky to have met you. I'm happy to have seen your smile.
Ah, it's so mundane but I love you
What'll happen?
I want to play with you forever and ever
Hearing your voice from afar makes me feel happy
We feel the same way
I understand what you're wishing for
No matter what happens, as long as we have a blast, it'll be alright!
We'll make you happy in this new way
I know that we feel the same
I always know
I understand what your feelings are
