In the face of the obstacles that stand in our way
Our hearts flare up and so burning
If, uniting our identical feelings,
We join hands, we will become infinite!
Rewarding good and punishing evil is our style
Are you ready for join us?
It's the deathly show time, time, time!
Let's do a full combo, bang-bang-bang!!
Raise a giant whirlwind
Get a chance and take it
We will fight; 3, 2, 1
Be as one!!!
It's enough that I have what I want to protect, so that I can become stronger!
My power is growing rapidly!!
We cannot lose!
Now, when a strong tailwind is blowing,
The stage is set for us.
Let's reach out to a future without conflict
Hey, let’s go!! Be as one!!!
Even in a critical situation, laugh and pretend to be strong
Most importantly: never give up
Access to emotions is completely open, with full throttle
Bye-bye to my timid me
The escape route is cut off, it's so exciting
Are you ready for a critical situation?
We will be fine, fine, fine
Let's strike back, bump-bump-bump!!
There's a loophole, we'll break through
Just go ahead, we're going now
We'll make our way; 3, 2, 1
Aiming for where the goddess of victory smiles at us,
We can trust each other; our bonds are our power!!
We can't stop!
Let's give everything we have now
This is how we overcome our limits
We're not alone, only this makes us invincible
Hey, let's go!! Be as one!!!
We're outnumbered, let's make a victory cry!
We won't retreat a single step! Nor break! We're fighters!!
Let's keep our resolve and go on
They are irreplaceable; now that we're with our comrades,
We become one
We cannot lose!
Now, when a strong tailwind is blowing,
The stage is set for us
Let's reach out to a future without conflict
Hey, let's go!! Be as one!!!
Be as overwhelming one!!!
