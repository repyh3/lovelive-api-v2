Full steam ahead! Full steam ahead! Currently in progress, dreaming!
Full steam ahead! Full steam ahead! Celebrating adventure, dreaming way!
When I stretched, saying: "Hurray!"
I want to go to an unknown place
So let's have some fun
C'mon, our journey starts here
From the window, where the light comes in
I'd like to ask the sky:
How far will we go?
Yeah... I know, as far as we can go
If you feel that you love something dearly, don't forget it
That thrill will always be your guide
It should light you up
Let's embrack on a journey with love in our hearts
Full steam ahead! Full steam ahead! Currently in progress, dreaming!
Full steam ahead! Full steam ahead! Celebrating adventure, dreaming way!
Ready, go! We're moving further with each step
Chasing after our desires
The tracks lead to tomorrow
Ah, our journey will never end
Your voice echoes in my heart
Singing a nostalgic song
We will always be together
Yeah... I know we will always be together
I love this world
I want to enjoy it more boldly
I want to travel through a time that feels like forever
No matter how far we are from each other,
We will always remain connected
From the expected departure via hopes through to happiness
We all run together, with our dreams in sight
If you feel that you love the present, don't forget it
That thrill will always be your guide
It should light you up
Let's embrack on a journey with love in our hearts
I'm sure we'll meet again!
Full steam ahead! Full steam ahead! Currently in progress, dreaming!
Full steam ahead! Full steam ahead! Celebrating adventure, dreaming way!
