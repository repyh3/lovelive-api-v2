Sha la la... the usual music,
It never stops sounding everywhere
Sha la la... the usual music,
Please, pay attention to me quickly!
Today again my results are so-so...
I draw the midnight routine in my notebook
Every day is a dizzying day,
I drop it in sounds and it's beautiful
The neon light floods my darkened room
Imagining that I'm on stage, I'm trying to dance
Using a hairbrush as a microphone
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!!
This is pretend magic!
Sha la la... the usual music,
It even turns minus into plus. This is incomparable music.
So I have to become more honest
I don't have to worry about trends anymore
I sing about the feelings that overwhelm me
I'll make them shine
Sha la la... the usual music,
It never stops sounding everywhere
Sha la la... the usual music,
I'm ready to believe in a new premonition! This is my music.
I'm becoming more and more interested in this
I can't stop, it's just my bad habit
The angel and the demon whispered to me again:
"After all you can"t give up!"
"Why don't you give up? You will feel better"
You, left and right, shut up!
There is a melody line in my head
The drums come in and then the bass joins in
But why is everything not going the way I imagined?
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!!
Am I lacking logic!?
Sha la la... the usual music,
Beautiful music that touches anyone to the core
I have to become the strongest, to be able to write it
I can easily afford to be in the trends
Even in my sleep I'm singing
And playing music
I don't want to wake up
The power hidden in the combination of do-re-mi,
I'm still looking for it.
I won't give up! This is the music that the whole world demands
C'mon!!
Hey! Hey! Clap n' clap!!
Hey! Hey! Clap n' clap!!
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!!
This is pretend magic!
Sha la la... the usual music,
It even turns minus into plus. This is incomparable music.
So I have to become more honest
I don't have to worry about trends anymore
I sing about the feelings that overwhelm me
I'll make them shine
Sha la la... the usual music,
(I'll make it real)
I'm not good at music yet
Sha la la... the usual music,
I'm ready to believe in a new premonition! This is my music.
The usual music
