La la la~
I hear the sound of my dream coming true, ah
Feeling that it was calling me, I ran on the way home
I will continuously chase my dream
After all I can't lie to my racing heartbeat anymore, right?
Look at me softly, because I'm changing
Bloom in all its glory, my dream, I wonder how far I can go?
I gently spread the awakened wings on my back
If only it could reach you right now...
I'll send it on the blue wind straight to you
Bloom in all its glory, my singing voice, embark on a never-before-seen world
Far, far away...
The feelings trapped in my heart
(Let me hear them too)
If I hum, the melody will carry my words
One by one, I was overwhelmed with feelings!
How many nights does it take for me to change,
While I sometimes feel fear and doubt?
I wonder if you'll hear, in the distant future
This pure song that I saw in a distant dream?
From when will it be?
Bloom in all its glory, my dream, I wonder how far I can go?
I gently spread the awakened wings on my back
If only it could reach you right now...
I'll send it on the blue wind straight to you
Bloom in all its glory, my singing voice, embark on a never-before-seen world
Far, far away...
