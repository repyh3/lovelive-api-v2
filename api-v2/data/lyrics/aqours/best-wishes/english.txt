The laughter echoing throughout the town is so dazzling to me...
But you know, I pray for that happiness to continue
Close yet still far away, unable to step forward
Summoning courage, I grasp the pen
And put my feelings into words
Even if I knock on the door and there's no answer
My kind feelings overflow
Someday, I want to properly express my "thank you"
We exchange feelings, connecting through letters
We surely can understand each other
With your own feet, with your own eyes, feel
Come and confirm the warmth of this town
For you, for you are my best wishes
I don't want to leave you alone, so I reach out little by little
With my step and yours, let's change the future
Everyone carries their own unique feelings and lives with them
Everyone, everyone is doing their best
Riding on the sea breeze, I hear a harmony
The song is complete only when you're here
The true me that I had hidden,
I have to confirm deep within my heart
The letters pile up one after another
Each time, they make me stronger
Shedding off the anxiety, lifting my head
I put my hand on the doorknob
Exchanging feelings, connecting through letters
We surely can understand each other
Feel the beginning with your whole being
I'll go to confirm the warmth of this town
La la lu la, I write with all my heart
My best wishes for you
