The ocean's heartbeat blends in with the blue breeze
All kinds of memories dance with the wind
Each and every one of them is important
I want to keep feeling the joy of making our wishes come true
Our hearts are connected, while the world meets with
The horizon that I can see
If you use some courage to get back up,
You'll have the strength to carry on.
First, you have to smile, and then keep doing your best.
It's going to be okay.
Dreams are endless.
As long as you don't give up, they'll last forever.
Something I wanted to do was born today
And it makes me want to dance.
Dreams are endless.
Let's chase after them as far as we can go
To the thrill that lays ahead of us,
Let's hold onto it together, forever!
The waves sing the melody I had once forgotten.
Simple words that I heard when I was a child
Suddenly come flooding back to me.
"This love is the strongest kind,"
I shouted at the top of my lungs.
So let's laugh. Then go from running to making so much noise.
It'll be okay, right?
The future is endless.
When it starts to get difficult,
It's best to take a break.
There's no need to be reckless.
The future is endless.
I want to talk about these dreams forever.
An unknown adventure is waiting for us;
We'll get through it together. Together!
This large hope, ah, we'll draw it as we move.
We have to keep moving. We have to keep moving.
But where to? A place where our dreams lie.
Dreams are endless.
As long as you don't give up, they'll last forever.
There's so many things I want to do today,
So let's do all of them!
Dreams are endless.
Let's chase after them as far as we can go
To the thrill that lays ahead of us,
Let's hold onto it together, forever!
