The seasons always rush us by
Leaving behind nothing but memories
No matter how much fun we had in those times
But the feelings in our hearts, they'll never fade
When I close my eyes, I see the summer sunshine
Embracing tightly those days gone by, I...
Maybe I'll start sketching out a plan for the future
What do I want to do this time round?
Meeting you charted out
So many different paths for me to take
Whispering to myself
I vow to never forget the time when our hearts became one
Its radiance will continue forevermore
It'd be nice if you caught my drift, even without me saying it out loud
I wonder, why does it feel like there's something in my eye
Something welling up within me, moments away from falling
They're × tears, not at all
The waves painted in a different color from back then
Even as I count them out on the sandy beaches
They won't ever return, those days gone by
I'm sure by this time tomorrow, I'll have a new dream in hand
I'll already be looking for the next exciting thing
I'm so glad I met you
Where should we go next? We'll search for the next path to take, we'll find it
The seasons always rush us by
Without anyone realizing, they've already come and gone
Never to return, that's why they're so precious
Whispering to myself
I vow to never forget the time when our hearts became one
Its radiance will continue forevermore
It'd be nice if you caught my drift, even without me saying it out loud
I wonder, why does it feel like there's something in my eye
Something welling up within me, moments away from falling
They're × tears, not at all
They're × tears, not tears at all
