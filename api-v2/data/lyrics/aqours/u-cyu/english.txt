The size of the universe that everyone is curious about
Let me secretly tell you, class
Alright,
Open your ears wide
And listen carefully,
OK?
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto
Everyone is in the solar system
Countless stars gather and are visible
The Milky Way is our galaxy
The Andromeda Galaxy
Over there is the Triangulum Galaxy
And there's the Virgo Supercluster
Dark matter, dark matter
The size of the universe is
930 billion light-years in diameter
But you don't have
To worry about that
Let's all have fun together

Around Jupiter,
Putting a ring on Saturn
On the far side of the moon,
Let's draw graffiti
One day,
I was
Thinking
So
Carelessly
While
Looking
At the sky
No one
Seems to notice,
So I'll put things
Back the way they were before
Wai wai wai...!
