Right now, there's a twinkling star swaying about, shall I make a wish on it?
I wish that I'll be able to hurry up and meet with you
I'll count all the things I want to do with you
It'll be fun, I'm getting excited already, and it's making me long to see you again
Surely, the connection we felt that day will always be there, forever!
Why is it that people can't spend their lives alone?  I've thought about that and
It's because I want to cherish someone, that makes me happy!
My heart is warm, growing bigger and bigger
Today, as always, I want to see you, I really do, but you're so far away
"I'll be there soon," I heard
Was it just my imagination? That's not it, that was your voice, right?
The lone star up high in the sky is illuminating a different place
I wish that I'll be able to see you tomorrow
But I know that that's impossible
I'm sad and getting lonely, a storm of tears is on the horizon
But even so, there's surely an unbreakable connection between us, I'm sure!
I know, all sorts of things have happened, so that's why I close my eyes and think,
I want to show off a more grown up version of myself, so I'll work hard!
My heart wants to leap straight ahead
Today, as always, I want to see you, I really do, so that's why
I reach my hand out toward the sky; please reach out your hand towards me
The star seems a bit busy, so I'll go and make my own wishes come true
So wait for me, I'm coming to see you, I'll definitely meet you someday
All sorts of things have happened, so close I close my eyes and think,
I want to show off a more grown up version of myself, so I'll work hard!
My heart wants to leap straight ahead
Today, as always, I want to see you, I really do, so that's why
I reach my hand out toward the sky; please reach out your hand towards me
Surely, our feelings will reach each other!
