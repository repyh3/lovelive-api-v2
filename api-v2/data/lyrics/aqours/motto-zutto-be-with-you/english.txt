The wish I thought of alone is still in my heart, even now
To gather glittering dreams, turn them into constellations,
And lost people on Earth will look at them for guidance
Is this a fantasy?
no, no, no, no, no! It's the future
From here on out, it's up to us to live and create
Things we love, and things we more than love, everyday
Like the countless stars in the sky
All kinds of exciting things shine in this big sky
Let's meet, let's meet, I want to be with you
Don't be ashamed of wanting something so badly
Erase any doubts you have about your wish coming true
From here on out, let's devote our hearts
To only things we truly love, and more than love
I want our newborn hope
To absorb kindness instead of tears
So I hold it close - I want to be with you more, forever
Like the countless stars in the sky
All kinds of exciting things shine in this big sky
Let's meet, let's meet, I say
I just want to tell you, and gaze into each other's eyes someday
I'm sure it was a coincidence our threads of fate intertwined
But I'd rather call it "inevitable"
Because I think it would be too hard to be apart from you
From here on out, let's devote our hearts
To only things we truly love, and more than love
I want our newborn hope
To absorb kindness instead of tears
So I hold it close - I want to be with you more, forever
