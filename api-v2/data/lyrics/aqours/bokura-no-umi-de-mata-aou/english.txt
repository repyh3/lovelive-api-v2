These new words turn into a nostalgic song
They accumulate turning into a different feeling
Those are the precious feelings we have since met until now
No matter the time, we'll always be connected
If it's by chance of life that you and I live in the same world
Will this be our bond? It's a beautiful coincidence, right?
We're all in the middle of a journey to find something fun, that's right!
Somewhere near here or faraway from here, we'll met again
We're all in the middle of a journey to find something fun
Let's talk after we've had many more adventures
Sometimes it happens without you noticing,
If you want me to be your side, then our feelings are the same color
The meaning of meeting someone is to be together
May it never change, may we always be connected
Life is a challenge, you and I will find our dreams and go after them
With a bond in our hearts, right? We still have more challenges left
It's like each of our wishes shines through, it's the sea!
I'll never forget the tears I shed nor the tears I received
Each of our wishes are shining, and the waves are dancing
We'll dance too, no matter if we're apart
Don't worry, you'll understand!
In our sea, always in our sea, the time that's gone, the waves
Though it's just a moment, it's a moment I'll never forget
It's not just what you can see...
It's like each of our wishes shines through, it's the sea!
We'll meet again here, we'll surely see each other again
We're all in the middle of a journey to find something fun
Let's talk after we've had many more adventures
