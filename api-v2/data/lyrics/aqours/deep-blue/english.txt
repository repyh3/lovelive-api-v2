Led by invitation, I took a step forward towards
The writing of this hard story
With the face of a savior,
I continue advancing step by step
(What is going on?)
Rejecting the despair that attacks us
(Head up to the blue)
All the way to the depths
(We are ready now)
I'm scared, but I won't run away anymore
(Don't stop moving on)
Steep up more and more
I'm trembling with an irresistible feeling of delight
On the other side of a still invisible dream
At the end of the revolving world,
Let's see what's waiting
It's not about the result, but about the hope that we catch
I'm betting on this moment.
Past memories will
Connect through songs
I won't forget them, I don't want them to be forgotten. Vision calling me, shout into the future.
As if even fragments of light
Cannot reach the bottom of the sea
Not everything goes according to plan,
Even I don't have any expectations
(Continue without thinking, and make bad decisions)
Let's stop betting on luck.
(We can't give up on our dreams halfway, don't you know?)
We want to know what victory tastes like, okay?
If I encounter obstacles, give me the strength to endure it,
So that I can move on, looking only forward
Messages from the past emerge
To the surface again and again
Overcoming this paradox isn't easy,
But it's not impossible either
Pain and suffering,
And all the negative emotions we can't control
Will be purified, even if we take a detour. Inherit our feelings, and let them resonate in the future.
Surrendering to this flowing (melody)
To outrun the past (let's run through the present)
At the end of the revolving world,
Let's see what's waiting
It's not about the result, but about the hope that we catch
I'm betting on this moment.
Past memories will
Connect through songs
I won't forget them, I don't want them to be forgotten. Vision calling me, shout into the future.
