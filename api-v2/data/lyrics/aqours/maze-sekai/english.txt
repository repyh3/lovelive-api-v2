Maze! We'll never make it outside
Maze! Our world might just be
Ah, on the brink of collapse
That's why I want you to steel yourself
Don't let me down
The map in our hands contains nothing but jibberish
The sky has dyed itself in a mysterious color
Even so, because you remain here by my side
I don't believe that our futures are bleak
I'll trust in your words
When you once told me that you'd bring me to see something new
Getting on the airship in the middle of this wasteland
Apparently it's the last flight available
I've decided to never give up
So come along with me, let's head off together
What I want to protect
Dream! Is the world I see in my dreams
Dream! A world where we can talk about the future with a smile
Start! We'll head off in search of it
Start! As soon as you're ready
Ah, together, we'll search for something we should do
I want to live on with determination in my heart
Don't stop my mind
Even if turbulence plagues our takeoff and landing
Even with the flashing thunder against our backs
Somehow, I feel more excited than uneasy
Let's spin the propellers of courage
Indeed, even though this will probably be a dangerous journey
I still want to move forward, even as the sky swirls with chaos
So let's head off together, we'll be together forever
In times of change
Dream! As we look upon our dreams
Dream! If we don't take our first steps out from this nightmare
Maze! We'll never make it outside
Maze! Our world might just be
Ah, on the brink of collapse
That's why I want you to steel yourself
Don't let me down
I've decided that I'll become strong
I could set off on this journey by myself
But if I'm with you... That'd be great!
What I want to protect
Dream! Is the world I see in my dreams
Dream! A world where we can talk about the future with a smile
Start! We'll head off in search of it
Start! As soon as you're ready
Ah, together, we'll search for something we should do
I want to live on with determination in my heart
Don't stop my mind
