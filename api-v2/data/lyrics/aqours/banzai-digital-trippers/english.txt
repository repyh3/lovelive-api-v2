Let's live our life inside of our dreams, Wow wow
And celebrate our failures as well
We want to always shine, Wow wow
And transform into our dazzling selves!
Right?
Let's count the number of things we want to do (let's do it!)
Once we're done, it'll begin (let's see...)
At last, we have become digital trippers
(We're about to meet in this big, wide world!?)
Let's try to hide the nerves (so nervous!)
Just close your eyes! You'll calm down that way (why oh why?)
Now is the time to open the door to your destiny!
From now on, (wow! Wow!) I'm going to do amazing things
Oh? Wait! (Did I say too much?)
Of course not, it's not a problem!
I love this side of you, alright! (I love, love, love, love it!)
Let's go together!
Let's live our life inside of our dreams, Wow wow
And celebrate our failures as well
We want to always shine, Wow wow
And transform into our dazzling selves!
Let's live our life inside of our dreams, Wow wow
And celebrate with a smile
We want to shine, Wow wow
Raise both hands (BAN-BANZAI!)
Above your head (BAN-BANZAI!)
It's not about winning or losing, it's about having fun, right? Yes!
I want nothing but nice things (am I being selfish?)
If you want it, then let's find it! (Yay, that's good!)
That's why we're agile digital trippers
(We're going to fly to a far, faraway world!?)
Believe what you want to believe (so exciting!)
Should we have fun on this exciting trampoline? (so bouncy!)
If you don't ask for it, then it won't appear. That's how things work here!
From now on, (strong! Strong!) I'll definitely become stronger
Hey, even you will (power up too!)
Of course not, it's not a problem!
I love this transformation that you deserved (I love, love, love, love it!)
Let's go together!
We are invincible inside of our dreams, Wow wow
And our courage dances to a happy tune
We want to shine for all eternity, Wow wow
And always be our hard-working selves!
We are invincible inside of our dreams, Wow wow
And we'll celebrate our talent for having fun!
We want to shine, Wow wow
Just say it (BAN-BANZAI!)
In a loud voice (BAN-BANZAI!)
Rather than cheat, actually put some effort in. Get set, and go!
An initial impulse gives us a shining outbreak
Unlimited passion gives us a glittering transmission
Hoo- I want a future that celebrates into the sky -ray!
Life is still a work in progress
You're still dreaming? You're bathed in light!
Everyone, let's go and fly into the sky
If you give it a go, you'll grow as a person
Hand in hand, flying even higher
Ah, what is about to happen!?
I'll see you anywhere, anywhere I go (at anytime)
We'll make the impossible possible (whenever we want)
The us of today we do our very best
Let's play to our heart's content
That's right! That's right! That right!!
Let's live our life inside of our dreams, Wow wow
And celebrate our failures as well
We want to always shine, Wow wow
And transform into our dazzling selves!
Let's live our life inside of our dreams, Wow wow
And celebrate with a smile

Raise both hands (BAN-BANZAI!)
Above your head (BAN-BANZAI!)
What will we get?
Just say it (BAN-BANZAI!)
In a loud voice (BAN-BANZAI!)
It's not about winning or losing, it's about having fun, right? Yes!
