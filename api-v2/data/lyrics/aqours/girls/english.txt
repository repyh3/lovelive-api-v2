Being a girl is so much fun
No one can interrupt our conversation
When it flies in the blink of an eye,
This mysterious moment
Makes me smile!
What did you say?
Quickly, show me the profile of your face unfamiliar to me
Nothing! The shy you
Shines brighter than anyone else
I'm not going home yet today
I can't live without sweets and midnight gatherings!
I'm so excited, it's weird
If only such time would go on forever and ever and ever
Being a girl is so much fun
No one can interrupt our conversation
When it flies in the blink of an eye,
This mysterious moment
Makes me smile!
I was so surprised! Just being with everyone is so much fun
The feelings that naturally overwhelm us,
The veil, hiding them until yesterday, is instantly dissipated
We are special!
We got too carried away, hey, what time is it?
Oh well, perhaps it's a good thing
The memories of everyone that I hear for the first time
Make me love you more and more
Stars sparkle in the night sky
Seeing it with everyone is something special for me
My heart is beating so fast, isn't that wonderful?
I have always, always, always dreamed of such a time
Being a girl is so much fun
When we can share anything,
This mysterious moment that
Flies in the blink of an eye
Makes me smile!
Like I cast a spell,
I say goodbye bye to all problems
But I'm sure that soon
I will start to worry again
Can I talk to you then?
La La la
Being a girl is so much fun
No one can interrupt our conversation
When it flies in the blink of an eye,
This mysterious moment
Makes me smile!
I was so surprised! Just being with everyone is so much fun
The feelings that naturally overwhelm us,
The veil, hiding them until yesterday, is instantly dissipated
We are special!
Hey, when are we going to meet next?!
After all we are special!
