Hey, listen, I've thought about this for a while,
How can I make everyone happy?
When the people I love smile,
That's it, that's enough to make me happy
Running down the long white beach, chasing after the sunset
I want to tell you how I feel
But every single time, I can't say the words. But...
I have to say it. I have to say it.
I want you to understand, so I go for a run.
I struggle to breathe, but I don't stop.
I have to say it. I have to say it.
I want to be with you
I want to always look at the same ocean with you.
RUN×RUN RUN×RUN; the air is
RUN RUN RUN; so cold
RUN×RUN RUN×RUN; I'll run a bit faster because it feels nice
Hey, listen, I really want to see you today
Why do I feel so selfish?
When I smile with the people I love,
That's it, that's enough to make it fun
A bird is gently gliding over the pale blue waves
Instead of envying their wings, I'll run. I'll deliver my feeling via a run.
I want to tell you. I want to tell you.
Maybe saying "I like you" isn't enough
What am I supposed to do? I'll go for a run!
I want to tell you. I want to tell you.
I wonder if it's just me.
I want to always look at the same ocean with you.
The sun is setting.
Hey, listen, I've thought about this for a while,
How can I make everyone happy?
I have to say it. I have to say it.
I want you to understand, so I go for a run.
I struggle to breathe, but I don't stop.
I have to say it. I have to say it.
I want to be with you
I want to always look at the same ocean with you.
RUN×RUN RUN×RUN; the air is
RUN RUN RUN; so cold
RUN×RUN RUN×RUN; I'll kick the sand because it feels nice
RUN×RUN RUN×RUN; surely,
RUN RUN RUN; you're waiting for me
RUN×RUN RUN×RUN; I'll run a bit faster to meet you at that place
