Ah, I don't know
What the weather will be like a year from now!
It's not something worth worrying about so just go with the flow
Don't worry too much
About doing everything right!
It's more fun learning from the mistakes you make
Let's take a slow, deep breath
You'll notice how nice the air tastes
Everyone gobbles up their food
And feels happy
Let's start from there
You don't have to decide now. You don't. Yes! Go with the flow!?
Gobble up your food
And take a nap when you feel full
Close your eyes and you'll see
All your worries disappear
Ah, I think I get it!
But one moment later, I'm not sure I do.
But I smile anyway because I want to enjoy myself in this moment.
I peacefully look up at the sky
It felt like I was aimlessly wandering around
If we steadily walk at our own pace today,
We'll be chasing the white clouds.
Let's clear our minds,
Because people tend to overthink things.
Everyone gobbles up their food
And feels happy
Let's start from there
You don't have to decide now. You don't. Yes! Go with the flow!?
Gobble up your food
And take a nap when you feel full
Close your eyes and you'll see
All your worries disappear
