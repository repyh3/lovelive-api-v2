(Pan Pin Pan Pin Paradise Chime)
Come on! Can everyone hear me? O.K.??
(Pan Pin Pin Pin Paradise Chime)
Let's go! The future's sound is endless
Paradise Chime
The words that my body knew
Let's go my way to be free
Just forget about what everyone else thinks
(My heart is going to fly far away, Jumping up!)
(Hi Hi Hi touch Hi touch)
Come on, move up through the ranks
(Hi touch Hi touch by instinct)
Today, I'd be happy if we sung together
Let's make a big dream chime
Pan Pin Pan Pin Pin Chime, let it chime now!
(I'm sure you want to chase after all my dreams)
I can't stop, I can't stop
I can't look back now
So Paradise, Paradise Chime
The chime of premonition
Will give life to something more fun
Let's believe in what tomorrow will bring
Who do you want to become? Let's draw many things!
Pan Pin Pan Pin Paradise Chime
Pan Pin Pan Pin, head towards a paradise
Pan Pin Pan Pin Paradise Chime
I know everyone can hear me
(What's my future?)
I don't know! Do you know? Well, I do know one thing
(I'll be with you!)
Every day is a lesson for the future, do my best
I wanna do it, I wanna try it, power up
Don't stop, don't stop, non stop the power
I need you more than you know
Let's be together forever!
(When a voice calls out to all of you)
I feel you, I feel you
Are you getting excited yet?
So Paradise, Paradise Chime
The chime of hope
Is when it makes sense for this to start
Let's believe in our inspiration
The exit arrow point to a directionless dream
Pan Pin Pan Pin Paradise Chime
Pan Pin Pan Pin, head towards a paradise
Pan Pin Pan Pin Paradise Chime
Everyone can hear me, right? Let's go!
I took it for granted when I felt lost in this shaky world
Ring a chime, what resonated in my heart
Were the various ways to have fun
We'll work it out somehow, so now everybody, come with me yeah!
So Paradise, Paradise Chime
The chime of premonition
Will give life to something more fun
Let's believe in what tomorrow will bring
Who do you want to become? Let's draw many things!
Pan Pin Pan Pin Paradise Chime
Pan Pin Pan Pin, head towards a paradise
Pan Pin Pan Pin Paradise Chime
I know everyone can hear me
Everyone can hear me, right? Let's go!
