The light is dazzling
The sun is relentless
You know...I have a lot on my mind
I really do!
This sentimental lemonade
Is a little sour
Who will I swim with in the future?
I want to stay with you forever. I want to!
Hey! Hey!! Summer isn't over yet
Let's play to our heart's content
A coconut-like breeze blows past, it's an aroma I know very well
In this moment, the scorching heat of the sand
Spills onto our bare feet
Let's have fun! This summer will only happen once
This sentimental mango pudding
Is swaying slightly
Will I ever change in the future? Do I even want to change?
It's a sweet taste with a hint of bitterness
Hey! Hey!! Summer, please don't go
I wish I could make it stay forever
Blue Hawaiian shaved ice melts slowly under the blue sky
Summer beach, I miss you!
We can't stop the dreaming days
After drinking lemonade, let's swim some more
I want to stay with you forever. I want to!
Hey! Hey!! Summer isn't over yet
Let's play to our heart's content
A coconut-like breeze blows past, it's an aroma I know very well
Hey! Hey!! Summer, please don't go
I wish I could make it stay forever
Blue Hawaiian shaved ice melts slowly under the blue sky
