On top of the mountain, look at the clouds below
There's no higher peak than up here
The thunder rolls far away from my feet,
Mt. Fuji is the highest peak in Japan
We say: "Good morning"
To the newborn today
As soon as we take a deep breath of fresh air,
Let's go!
Let's show our serious energy.
OK? OK! Start, without holding back
If you believe in the power of having a dream,
It will surely grow.
Is it easy? Or is it difficult?
My heart... says that I can do it
What, what sky do you want to fly in? I want to fly in the endless sky.
Shall we aim for the unknown?
What, what sky do you want to fly in? I don't know, so let's just fly.
Our capabilities are constantly expanding
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine!
When you think it's good timing,
It's the right time
After we face our clumsiness,
The new development of our story begins with meetings and courage
OK? OK! Real experience→physical sensation→pleasant feeling
You can't live with only dreams
But looking away from them,
Looking for a reason to abandon them, is just boring.
Everyone... do what you want
The sky is expanding further and further. Everything in this world is interconnected.
It's born in Numazu and grows throughout the Earth
The sky is expanding further and further. The sky, Fuji, sunshine!
We want to shine forever
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine!
Ah, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine!
It's the blue sky, but where is Mt. Fuji?
Far in the sky, our tears
Are the blue sky, but they turn into smiles.
If you dream of going to a place higher than mountains, you can probably fly
That's why, that's why we love the sky
What, what sky do you want to fly in? I want to fly in the endless sky.
Shall we aim for the unknown?
The sky is expanding further and further. The sky, Fuji, sunshine!
We want to shine forever
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine!
Ah, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine!
