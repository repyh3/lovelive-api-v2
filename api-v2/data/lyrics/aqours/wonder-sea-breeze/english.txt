The long-awaited day has come
This morning even the sound of the waves is not the same as usual
I had a good feeling about it
Hey, I'm not the only one who is so happy, right?
La la la, it's like a dream
At the bottom of the cold sea (so dark)
So that no one gets lost (no way)
We came with everyone we can mutually trust!
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Let's go!!)
If I can sing along with you, with you
Maybe I won't be afraid? We are invincible!
Guided by the wind and the sun,
Now, become one (let's become one)
Linking (we are linked)
All over the world it resonates, wonder sea breeze (we'll deliver it!)
Hello happy days, it floats all over the city.
We start running towards
The future written on the sandy beach
It's proof of our hard work that we're all here
La la la, this is vital to us.
On the edge of a wide, wide see (swimming)
Thanks to the fact that I was able to meet you (we met)
I was ready to face off at any moment!
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Let's go!!)
If I can laugh with you, with you
Even my yesterday was radiant and beautiful?
With wind and sun as allies
I dream (let's dream)
Let's play (we play)
All over the world it resonates, wonder sea breeze
If I can sing along with you, with you
Maybe I won't be afraid? We are invincible!
Guided by the wind and the sun,
Now, become one (let's become one)
Linking (we are linked)
All over the world it resonates, wonder sea breeze (we'll deliver it!)
I smelled a nostalgic scent
I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure that nothing can stop us anymore!
