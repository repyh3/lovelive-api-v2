How far does it go? The end of the blue sky
Change the shape of your wishes and let them fly
Up until now and from now on
I'll keep thinking of those important to me
Whether they're close by or far away
Yesterday brings forth today
And sees us off at the path that leads us to tomorrow
Gently hold the fingertips you were searching for
Dive into the aurora-like water
If I could become like an arrow of light
That illuminates the sea
Ah, maybe I'd be happy? I'd be happy!
So light up the courage in your heart
Everyone will go on a journey
I want to tell you that I'll always be waiting for you here
But will this change?
Up until now and from now on
I want to protect you
Can I get stronger? I won't lose...to the sea breeze!
Yesterday brings forth a new day
With a song that leads us to tomorrow
Those singing voices are no match for such sad words
Let's have fun flying around
The arrow of light pointing at the boat
Stands reliably on the coastline
Ah, I want to be like a lighthouse
A light that illuminates everyone
Yesterday brings forth today
And sees us off at the path that leads us to tomorrow
Gently hold the fingertips you were searching for
Dive into the aurora-like water (aurora of the sea and sky)
If I could become like an arrow of light
That illuminates the sea
Ah, maybe I'd be happy? I'd be happy!
So light up the courage in your heart
