La la la La la la
Bloomed in my heart
My, our
La la, song of courage
We have finally found the final melody
The words you gave us ring in our hearts
On these feelings that you continued to mute
We will shed hope, sing along (sing along)
If our voices unite,
Your loneliness will also immediately get decrescendo
With this melody you will meet it face to face
Soar up, soar up, our harmony
Convey our desires, connect our feelings together
If we continue to believe,
Waves and sounds will shine
La la la La la la
Bloomed in my heart
My, our
La la, song of courage
Harsh reality stood in our way,
All we can do is pray
But at the same time our smiles become legato
It's time to connect them, sing along (sing along)
Stop covering your ears
From the cacophony of your sadness
Overlapping and deepening,
The power of each of us began to shine
We won't leave anyone behind
While the immature sea breeze blows through us,
Let us all row our boat together
If our voices unite,
Even our struggle will become cantabile
And we will sing firmly again
We won't let anyone take it away
This is a story for us
Soar up, soar up, our harmony
By combining our efforts, we will deliver it to the sky
If we all keep singing,
The clouds will part and the darkness will dissipate
La la la la la la
We met
You met me and we started walking
La la la La la la
Bloomed in my heart
My, our
La la, song of courage
