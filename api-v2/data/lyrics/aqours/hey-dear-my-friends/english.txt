I thought I was the only one who couldn't be honest
Therefore I'm happy that I can find mutual understanding with someone
Now I can sing
Because you were by my side,
I'm not alone anymore, I'm not alone anymore
I dreamed about it all the time
But I didn't know what I should do
Turns out a single feeling can change the scenery, it's so amazing
In a world that seemed so far-far away to me
I'm not alone anymore, I'm not alone anymore
After more and more new meetings and partings,
I started to fear being alone
But now it's time to say goodbye to the me who lied to myself
You gave me the courage to open the door
I'm not alone anymore, I'm not alone anymore
Thank you for believing in me
Our desires are now echoing
Hey, dear my friends
Just because I can laugh with you,
It's so, so much fun
What should we call the fact
That we were able to meet
In this city full of worries?
Afraid of being hurt again
I couldn't meet myself face to face, but,
Because I'm with everyone, now everything is fun for me!
I hate the time of my loneliness, but,
When I'm with everyone, I can smile
I thought it was too late, but, looking at you,
I realized it wasn't
I can't believe that I can try so hard for someone
But I quite like this me, so it's okay
Now I can sing my way,
Because I'm not alone anymore, I'm not alone anymore
Thank you that we met
My future is starting to change
Hey, dear my friends,
Just that I can share my tears with you,
Everything is so, so wonderful
What should we call the fact
That we were able to meet
In this city full of worries?
