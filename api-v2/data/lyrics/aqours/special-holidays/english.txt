The blue sea, the blue sky, the bright sunlight is fresh and clear
Do you feel welcome in this town? It's exciting
What will we do? What do we want to do? Ideas overflow
Instead of thinking, let's do something right away!
Watermelon splitting, surfing, softball is also an option!
No need to hold back, let's have fun at 1000%
Let's burst with you!
Special holidays that only we have devised
A complete feast of joy and happiness
Our hearts grow closer and closer
Let's make this a day we'll never forget!
Now we come together as one
The night has already worn us out, it seems to happen to everyone
But it's a shame to go to sleep, right?
We lay on the beach under the bright starry sky
It's a shooting star! Let's make our longed-for
Bright future come true!
Special holidays where no one can interrupt us
The sea breeze blows away all the unpleasant things
No matter how much time we have, it's never enough
It's a bit painful... I want to feel your resonance
I want to keep joking with you!
Each of us has come this far
Taking different paths, with our own pace and feelings
This is not a coincidence
Special!! Special!! Special!!
It's simply destiny
We'll do it over and over again!
We'll gather again and again!
Let's make many memories
The best memories!
Special holidays that only we have devised
A complete feast of joy and happiness
Our hearts grow closer and closer
Let's make this a day we'll never forget!
We want to be surrounded by fun!
Our hands come together, feelings are conveyed, we become one
Yea, Special Holidays
(Woh, Woh, Woh oh oh...)
