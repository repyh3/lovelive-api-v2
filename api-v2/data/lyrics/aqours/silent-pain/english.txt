Theres nothing.... just empty hearts in a colourless tranquility
Tiny sounds of breathing, closed doors within my heart
Actually (Why...?) passion is more fragile than the tears we shed
Moonlight shimmers on the water's surface
Before the calm sunset dissolves into darkness
No one knows the gap between the future and the present moment
SILENT PAIN, I'm feeling it - "conflict called hope."
Even if I believe, even if I believe, it seems like it might fall apart
I don't want to stop the heartbeat of my dreams.
I'll gather my scattered courage again
If I draw a new tomorrow... will I be able to reach you?
Surely, I'll reach you
Hey, gently, from now on (run away)
With new days (I'll keep living)
All these thoughts come and go
Somebody... (help me...)
The step I took led me astray from my destiny
I have entered my world of solitude
SILENT PAIN, something within me is becoming dry
I will always, always be smiling here
A mirage is obscured by the imaginary sun
Crossing over to that day's dream
The light is there
A serenade of waves are on the verge of discord
(Yes) so keep on (dreaming) and singing
Embracing this pain too, now, is the next wave
Before I knew it, confusion had slipped in
It grew larger and the noise became louder
But I want to move on anyway
The place I aimed for continues to shine, always and forever.
It's painful
SILENT PAIN, I'm feeling it - "conflict called hope."
Even if I believe, even if I believe, it seems like it might fall apart
I don't want to stop the heartbeat of my dreams.
I'll gather my scattered courage again
If I draw a new tomorrow... will I be able to reach you?
Surely, I'll reach you
