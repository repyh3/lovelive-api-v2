The cherry blossoms of unfading dreams flutter and dance
The cherry blossoms of unfading dreams dancing in the sky are soaring towards the future
We all knew it, but we just didn't realize it until that day
A new season awaits at the end of the encounter
Even if it was just a bud until yesterday, it looks like it's about to bloom in all its glory
Does the fragrance sing of spring? Somehow it makes me cry
If the faint, faint, faint flowers want to see the sky
Let's go on a long journey, let's try to take off
This passionate heart still won't stop beating
Not understanding that someday it will turn into a memory
Ah, cherry blossoms, cherry blossoms! Do you want to bloom forever?
Why does the present keep passing by?
I close my eyes, wishing for the full bloom to last forever
The fragrance will one day be an illusion, but I won't forget
I'll send words of love, love, love, love.
I want to meet you when I'm in a joyful mood
As long as the strength of my feelings is conveyed
Even when one day it turns into a memory, I won't be lonely
Ah, cherry blossoms, cherry blossoms! Before the present passes by...
This time made up of individual moments is precious to me
It seems so close yet out of reach, will only the fragrance remain in my heart?
Will only the nostalgic fragrance remain?
But if the strength of my feelings is conveyed
Even if it turns into a memory, it will surely be fun!
This passionate heart still won't stop beating
Not understanding that someday it will turn into a memory
Ah, cherry blossoms, cherry blossoms! Do you want to bloom forever?
Why does the present keep passing by?
The cherry blossoms of unfading dreams flutter and dance
The cherry blossoms of unfading dreams dancing in the sky are soaring towards the future
