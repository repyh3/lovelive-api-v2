Hey, can you hear it?
We're traveling around the world with our voices and our sound
C'mon now!
No matter the distance
We'll meet-meet-meet you all; hurry up and...notice us already!
(OH MY GOSH)
Ride the wave, we can find a brand-new way
Ride the mystery with us
(OH MY GOSH)
Shining rain, wake up on a brand-new stage
You got a one-way ticket
We're never going back, so let's go
I wanna cha-cha-change
I wanna switch it up!
Take me awa-wa-way!!
KA-GA-YA-KI-RA-RI-RA
Say the magic words and anything will come true
KA-GA-YA-KI-RA-RI-RA
Where can I say the words? Anywhere is fine; Ooh woah woah woah-oh
The future is a road that connects to many places
Tell me more; TRUE YOU, TRUE YOU
The heartbeat of many dreams are sparkling! The future
Is in our ocean!! TRUE BLUE, TRUE BLUE
Let us be known all over the world!
(More!)
Our limit? We have none!
(Whoo-whoo!)
It'll never end, and I don't want it to. Therefore, it won't ever come to end.
KI-RA-RI; dancing hearts; I CATCH UP
KI-RA-RI; our dreams are shining; I'mma SNATCH UP
Aaah~ I can't wait anymore
We're not going to give up with every fibre of our beings
The power that defies all odds...that's our "shine".
Ready, Set it, Get it
POW!!
KA-GA-YA-KI-RA-RI-RA
At any time, always remember the spell of hope
KA-GA-YA-KI-RA-RI-RA
Whose words are they? They're everyone's words; Ooh woah woah woah-oh
Girls
And fantasy...
Shake it, Make it POP! POP!
Imagine, Create
Your Passion, Your Fate
Just dive in, Don't wait
Ah, this is fun!
I'll do it again today, and laugh with you as we walk into tomorrow
Let's have fun!
Today is only today, but tomorrow will shine even brighter!
KA-GA-YA-KI-RA-RI-RA
Say the magic words and anything will come true
KA-GA-YA-KI-RA-RI-RA
Where can I say the words? Anywhere is fine; Ooh woah woah woah-oh
The future is a road that connects to many places
Tell me more; TRUE YOU, TRUE YOU
The heartbeat of many dreams are sparkling! The future
Is in our ocean!! TRUE BLUE, TRUE BLUE
