I want to see something with amazing impact
My heart is restless, wanting to know so much more
A melody that is traced out naturally
Is spreading inside of me, from head to toe
And it can't be stopped
It feels like the world I longed for is out of reach
But I'll stretch my arm out a little more from afar
Is it still not enough?
I want the strength to make up my mind
To start something when I want to
Pure heart, what is it that I really want?
Instead of envying those can start something when they want to,
I'll just chase after my own interests
It would be nice if I could smile cutely
But it's so embarrassing, since it doesn't suit me
Maybe I shouldn't jump to conclusions
My voice keeps getting louder
I want to sing
I've always wanted to jump out into the world
It's reckless, but I'll go ahead with it anyway
Jump into an unknown future!
Which path do I take until
I accomplish what I want to achieve?
Pure wish, I think I'll try my best
When I accomplish what I want to achieve, my goal will be that light
I'll just chase after the things I love
As long as I keep this pure passion
I can focus on what's before me
Was it my choice to be born? Or was it more like an oath?
Pure heart Pure wish, ah!
This thrill won't disappear
When I accomplish what I want to achieve, my goal will be that light
That glimmering Pure heart Pure wish
I want the strength to make up my mind
To start something when I want to
Pure heart, what is it that I really want?
Instead of envying those can start something when they want to,
I'll never give up on the things that I love
