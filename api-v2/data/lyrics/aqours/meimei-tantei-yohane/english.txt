It's a mystery that strokes your instincts. There's two sides to every mystery.
Either way, I'm going to figure it all out.
So brace yourself and wait.
...I've been trying to tell you, but you seem confused.
These clues don't look right at all.
You've been exposed by the stray detective Yohane!?
Everyone has their own secrets.
That's why I get the most bizarre and complicated cases
Why, oh why? I want to do something about it
I will smile until the very end.
Along with playing the violin and fighting in a battle,
When it comes down to it, I'll use my magic
Bow down to the goddess of darkness.
I'm still not ready...not yet...!
Hiding your true feelings will cause riddles to be a lie and a truth.
No matter what happens, the culprit won't escape.
I think it's the time you give yourself up.
...I'm at a total loss of what to do;
I need to improve my intuition.
Maybe it'll come down to my sixth sense, then my seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth.
Awaken it! Now!!
The game is back on. Winning is the only way to complete it.
Chasing everywhere, being chased: the ultimate chase.
Game on! I'm almost there, almost at the end.
The stray detective is always alone.
The black wings appear on the back of a fallen angel.
We're about to get to the bottom of this
We are going to stand on a ledge. Are you prepared?
An exhilarating confession by the stray detective Yohane!?
I made a mistake and apologized, then started over
I'm so sorry that I was wrong again...
What's wrong with me? Oh, why can't I get it right?
My intelligence has awakened!
Everyone has their own secrets.
That's why I get the most bizarre and complicated cases
Why, oh why? I want to do something about it
I will smile until the very end.
Along with playing the violin and fighting in a battle,
When it comes down to it, I'll use my magic
Bow down to the goddess of darkness.
I'm still not ready...not yet...!
