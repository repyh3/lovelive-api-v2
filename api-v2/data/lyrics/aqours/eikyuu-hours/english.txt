Don't forget it, I won't forget it!
If we start counting, we'll never finish, right?
So many things have happened
When did it all start?
We go over the memories again and again
Say bye-bye to the reasons for giving up! Let's give it our all instead
We'll talk about the dreams we want to achieve
It has already started, before we realized it
We were running towards tomorrow
We knew the sky was so wide,
But it was incredibly blue
The same sea, the same place
Will always be waiting for us
Our dreams will never end (you and I) we've always dreamed of this (let's shine)
Let's always, always cherish the joy in our hearts
I want us to continue being together
Our dreams will never end (you and I) we've always dreamed of this (let's shine)
These joyful feelings will connect us forever and ever
Don't forget it, don't forget!
With strong voices, let's energeticaly shout, "yes, yes, yes!"
I wonder if our feelings were conveyed in our songs
It started from the moment we met
Now I finally feel it
Don't let the courage in your heart fade away,
Let's always be pure, just like we are
To the same sea, to the same place
I want to be someone I won't be ashamed of
Chasing our dreams (you and I) with the power of dreams (let's shine)
We believe in what we like, forever and ever
I want us to continue being together
Chasing our dreams (you and I) with the power of dreams (let's shine)
We believe in what we like, forever and ever
What I wish for, what I wish for, is happiness with you
(We'll keep laughing, hoping time goes on and on...)
Because I want to keep smiling...
I've been chasing my dream
I've been chasing my dream
The time I spend with you is precious, so precious. I'll hold you tight and never let you go!
Our dreams will never end (you and I) we've always dreamed of this (let's shine)
Let's always, always cherish the joy in our hearts
I want us to continue being together
Our dreams will never end (you and I) we've always dreamed of this (let's shine)
These joyful feelings will connect us forever and ever
Don't forget it, don't forget!
Don't forget it, I won't forget it, I won't forget it!
