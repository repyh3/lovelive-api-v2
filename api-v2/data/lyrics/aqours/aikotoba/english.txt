Let's do our best tomorrow
I'll vigorously do my rubesty with a smile
I'm always going to keep chasing after all of this love
I open the window to let the sunlight inside
Where should I go? Even if I'm alone, I'll take a leap of faith, yeah!!
What used to scare me doesn't anymore
Because I've grown up (right?)
Isn't that amazingly amazing! (The password is "I'll do my rubesty!")
I want to change, I can change
I have it in me (if I choose to do so)
I want to become stronger, even stronger
Because I still want to dream
Everyone knows that courage is important (it's important)
I know I get a little nervous sometimes, but (courage is important!)
Taking just one small step is where it all starts
Let's do our best tomorrow
I'll vigorously do my rubesty with a smile
I'm always going to keep chasing after all of this love
It's frustrating when I can't do it, so I'll use these feelings to jump
Someday, I'll be able to jump really high (that's right, that's right, I'll do my rubesty)
I want to make it happen, I will make it happen
I have it in me (I've made up my mind)
I'm so excited; I'm sure I can do so many things from now on
Yes, I want to give this a go!
I've got a lot of excitement and hope (I've got them)
But this time, I want to give them to everyone too (I'll give them to you)
Don't give up, keep going even if you fall down along the way
Let's do our best everyday
When you feel down, let's do a big "I'll do my rubesty"
I always want to support those I love so much
Everyone knows that courage is important
I know I get a little nervous sometimes, but
I'll do my rubesty, I'll do my rubesty! The password is I'll do my rubesty!
Let's do our best tomorrow (tomorrow)
I'll vigorously do my rubesty with a smile (with a smile)
I'm always going to keep chasing after all of this love
I'll vigorously do my rubesty!
