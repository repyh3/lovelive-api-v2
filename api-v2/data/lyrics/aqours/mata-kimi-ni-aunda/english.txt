I won't give up on my dream
I've decided that I won't give it up
Even when it feels like I can't reach it
I'll continue to keep trying
I thought I had been running by myself
But you were always there (always together)
I was so happy when I found out, I almost cried
No one can stop me
The seasons are changing, so let's depart
I am wherever I want to see myself
I'll rush out just to seek it
I'll see you again, somewhere
Ah, I'm chasing my dream
The joy and the pain
I know your tears are
More beautiful than gemstones
An awakened mind can't return to how it was
I have to venture out into wilderness (to the future)
I know that this thrill still makes my heart flutter
No one can stop me
A new day is born again
I wink at the flowers blooming at my feet
I'm going to fly far away
I'll see you again, surely we'll see each other again
The sea in spring, the blue summer, and the high sky in autumn
A winter scenery with the wind dancing on the beach
I'll never forget it, no matter where I go
No one can stop me
The seasons are changing, so let's depart
I am wherever I want to see myself
I'll rush out just to seek it
I'll see you again, somewhere
