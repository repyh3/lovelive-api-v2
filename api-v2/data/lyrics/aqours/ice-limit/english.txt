There's something I want to tell you,
And today's the day I'll finally say it
Not yet, not yet, not yet... maybe it's too soon?
No, no, no... it'll be okay!
I want to be like that admired couple,
"C'mon, let's go home together♡"
No way, no way, no way... be brave
Hold up, hold up, hold up... I ended up saying it!
(Did I startle them with what I said? Will they decide to turn me down?)
---Geez, I'm so embarrassed, my face feels like it's on fire, and my heart's about to jump out of my chest
(Did I startle them with what I said? Will they decide to turn me down?)
---Hey, hurry up, please. Just say something, anything!
Time feels like it has stopped, I just can't handle it!
woo, slow-motion moment
woo, your answer is a lie, isn't it? Really? "Let's go home!"
I'm head over heels, loving you to the extreme
Already at the ICE LIMIT
5･4･3･2･1
I'm melting, melting away
Looking up at your smile and the sunset
I hope my flushed cheeks don't get noticed
At each other's sides eating ice cups,
While waiting at the bus top
Sticking, sticking, sticking... is this a dream?
Pinching, pinching, pinching... go ahead and pinch my cheek!
(What are you thinking about right now? I wonder what's on your mind?)
---This isn't just a conversation with a classmate
I just want to know more and more about you!
woo, slow-motion moment
woo, I realized it again - truly, "I love you"
I'm head over heels, loving you to the extreme
Already at the ICE LIMIT
5･4･3･2･1
I'm melting, melting away
Looking up at your smile and the sunset
I hope my flushed cheeks don't get noticed
There's absolutely no way I could say it first,
Please confess to me, you can take the lead
I have to hurry up before all the ice melts,
There's no more time - I LOVE YOU
I'm head over heels, loving you to the extreme
Already at the ICE LIMIT
5･4･3･2･1
I'm melting, melting away
Looking up at your smile and the sunset
I hope my flushed cheeks don't get noticed, I love you
Because I want to stay forever, I want to be loved
Looking up at your smile and the sunset
I hope my flushed cheeks don't get noticed
