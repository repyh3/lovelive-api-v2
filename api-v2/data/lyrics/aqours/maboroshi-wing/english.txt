Change always happens suddenly
As always I landed in a city familiar to me
Where am I?
Indeed... where?
There are many realities, they branch out again and again
Do they choose us or do we choose them?
Am I an angel or a fallen angel?
You know who I am?
An angel, a fallen angel, or maybe even an illusion?
Come to me in any world
Find me!
Our hearts are drawn to each other, so we must meet
Come to me in any world
The instinct to want to be bound,
I always, always believe in it
I'm sure you will find me
So let's fly freely, let's fly, let's fly, let's fly
I'm flying
I like evolution, I want to challenge
It's not about whether I can do it or not, I'll just do it
Who am I?
Really... who?
I'll try to hope for perihelion, there are many ways to find out
Fear and excitement float in the night sky
Dream of an angel or dream of a fallen angel,
Which one is sweeter and prettier?
An angel wing, a fallen angel wing, isn't that an illusion?
I still don't even know what will happen in the future
I know one thing only —
You and I are drawn to each other, so we should meet
I still don't even know what will happen in the future
The instinct to want to make sure that everything
Never, never leaves me.
I would like to continue searching with you
Even if we're in an unfamiliar sky, let's fly, let's fly, let's fly, let's fly
I'm flying
Recolor your wings from simply beautiful to gorgeous
Ah, go beyond space and time and by all means find me anywhere
Because, nothing to do, such is fate
I still don't even know what will happen in the future
I know one thing only —
You and I are drawn to each other, so we should meet
Come to me in any world
Find me!
Our hearts are drawn to each other, so we must meet
Come to me in any world
The instinct to want to be bound,
I always, always believe in it
I'm sure you will find me.
So let's fly freely, let's fly, let's fly, let's fly
I'm flying
