Ah! No matter where we go, never forget
Brightest Melody
We have always wanted to be here
Everyone's feelings are definitely one
(Singing forever with everyone)
But there is a road ahead of us
With all kinds of futures, towards to the next excitement
Meetings, goodbyes
It is a repeating thing, we have come to understand this
But with a smile, try saying it from your heart
That we will meet again
A sparkling, shining dream is shining within us
A warm and big sparkle
Now, heading towards tomorrow, we want to start again
Something special, what is it?
That is... we wonder what that is! We are looking forward to it
We wanted to treasure this
Everyone is sweaty from the days when we did our best
(We practiced a lot, didn't we?)
If you try, you can do it
The future you painted; it's slowly becoming real
Goodbyes, meetings
As it is, we do not know which came first
But don't mind it, we feel from our hearts
That we will meet again
The wind is flowing smoothly, is it inviting us?
Try heading towards it; it is better than standing still
We have to go already
This painful feeling; we have to embrace this moment
Together towards the brightest melody
We want to shine! Move onwards with this feeling
Ah! No matter where we go, never forget
Brightest Melody
It seems that we were born again for this journey of singing
Ah! We have always wanted to live like this
Everyone's feelings surely are one, definitely!
A sparkling, shining dream is shining within us
A warm and big sparkle
Now, heading towards tomorrow, we want to start again
Something special, what is it?
That is... we wonder what that is! We are looking forward to it
A new dream, a new song; They both brought us together!
