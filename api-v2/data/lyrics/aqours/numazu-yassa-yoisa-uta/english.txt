Come on, come on, everyone, join our ensemble
Bom bom bom — the roar of a huge drum
Is quickly carried away into the forests and mountains
Let's sing: "one-two took"
Since ancient times towns and people
Have always walked hand in hand
Let's sing in gratitude for today's happiness
All together, all together, let's sing louder!
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle, come on)
Sky, sea and earth, thank you! So bright! (Sky, sea and earth, hurray! So bright!)
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle without hesitation)
Let everyone in the town liven up! So exciting! (More, all together, hurray! So exciting!)
Hah, let it sound everywhere
The song "one-two took" of Numazu
Come on, come on, everyone, join our ensemble
Pihyala — the cheerful sound of a flute sounds
Soar up, rustling winds
Let's make some noise with the words "one-two took"
Although we have hard days,
We thank and praise each other
Let's sing in congratulations at once
All together, all together, let's have fun!
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle, come on)
Sky, sea and earth, thank you! So bright! (Sky, sea and earth, hurray! So bright!)
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle without hesitation)
Let everyone in the town liven up! So exciting! (More, all together, hurray! So exciting!)
Hah, always be proud of
The song "one-two took" of Numazu
Gods, please, descend
Into these mysterious lands
Our voices are loud during prayer
Let the magic of our words reach the skies
Come on, come on, everyone, join our ensemble
Ting-a-ling — the bells are ringing casually
Thank you for your work, the bright sun
Let's laugh at the words "one-two took"
Blue sky and greenery all around,
The beauty of the vast sea,
I'm proud of my native land
All together, all together, let's shout about love for them!
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle, come on)
Sky, sea and earth, thank you! So bright! (Sky, sea and earth, hurray! So bright!)
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle without hesitation)
Let everyone in the town liven up! So exciting! (More, all together, hurray! So exciting!)
Hah, let it sound everywhere
The song "one-two took" of Numazu
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle, come on)
Sky, sea and earth, thank you! So bright! (Sky, sea and earth, hurray! So bright!)
Circle, circle, let's stand in a circle and dance (circle, circle, let's stand in a circle without hesitation)
Let everyone in the town liven up! So exciting! (More, all together, hurray! So exciting!)
Ah, let it sound everywhere
The song "one-two took" of Numazu
