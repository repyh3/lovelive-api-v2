A shiny welcome!
I want it to shine, and have a lot of fun
That's why I do my very best.
I've been thinking about a lot of things lately, Oh yeah!
I can try; I prefer having high expectations
As that's what motivates me.
I can try; if I confront it with passion,
The future will be shiny!
Doki-Doki Take off
No matter where we go, we always have a lot of fun
Can you tell how happy I am?
Maybe I'm being too annoying so I'll be quiet now.
I miss you; ah I can't say the words!
So I'll just hug you instead.
I miss you; I love everyone so much
What do I do? It's fine, right? I suppose it's fine!
I'll pursue happiness with everyone!
Love is all, I sing love is all!
When I tried singing with a straight face, I felt the urge to laugh a little
But, you know, it's how I'm feeling in the moment
Love is all, I sing love is all!
When I tried to sing alone, I just wanted to sing with everyone instead.
I think what I'm feeling when I want to be with everyone...
...Is love!
An exciting welcome!
I want us to be happy, and the world to be a fun place
After it rains, surely the sun will shine down on us.
I can fly; everyday is so wonderful
It's the best thing to share with everyone. Thank you my friends.
I can fly; I love everyone so much
That's fine with you, right? Are you sure? Obviously!
I'll grab hold of a lot of happiness with everyone!
Love is all, I sing love is all!
I think the thrill that blooms inside of me from the moment
I put all of my feelings into my singing...
...Is love!
Love is all, I sing love is all!
When I tried singing with a straight face, I felt the urge to laugh a little
But, you know, it's how I'm feeling in the moment
Love is all, I sing love is all!
When I tried to sing alone, I just wanted to sing with everyone instead.
I can hear our voices harmonizing
I think what I'm feeling when I want to be with everyone...
...Is love!
