Nice to see you again
I can tell you've become stronger
We'll overcome all these obstacles in our path
Shall we gently embrace this world?
Though our paths are different
When they intersect, let's walk hand in hand
Let's talk about the events that unfolded.
In our hearts is an unpolished gemstone of dreams
How do you want to make it shine?
Surely we'll find the answer in every encounter we've had.
We'll never give up on it.
We want to shine forever. Forever!
We all have our own power, we all have our own tears.
That's why I want to laugh here
I'll love you no matter what happens.
What kind of cut would be good for the unpolished gemstone of dreams?
Ah, may it shine so brightly.
Instead of holding onto this hope, we want to rush forward with a loud cry.
Our momentum goes in all directions
Because we want to shine.
Holding onto that unpolished gemstone of dreams
Will take us to a future of freedom.
Surely we'll find the answer in every encounter we've had.
We'll never give up on it.
Instead of holding onto this hope, we want to rush forward with a loud cry.
Our momentum goes in all directions
Because we want to shine.
Surely the answer lies in the encounters we've had so far.
Let's go to that future of freedom.
From now on, you'll shine even brighter. More!
Lalala...
