A voice, reaching not a soul, races through the night
Is this where hope is born, only for it to be left to die?
"No!", the blazing soul within my heart screams out
As it gasps for breath
Fight back, I'll struggle against my fate, as hard as I can
Hurry up, I want to believe, as much as I can
As much as I can? The truth that I finally open my eyes to
That it'll remain unfulfilled should I just stay silent
That it'll remain unfulfilled should I just yearn for it
The time is now, it's time to make a move
The pain and wails of the night feast upon your dreams
A voice, reaching not a soul, races through the night
I won't accept it, I can't bear for such a depressing world to exist
I can feel our hearts resonating as one...
I was not born in this world merely to experience the feeling of despair
"Run!", the whistle of my overbearing primal instincts
Push me on from deep within my heart
It echoes through the void, getting louder and louder
Let it echo through the void, getting louder and louder
Whip yourself into a frenzy, way past your breaking point
Even if it's impossible, we'll make it happen
We'll make it happen through sheer willpower alone
So long as we're willing to fight, it'll work out somehow
A beam of light, the sound of prayer, illuminates your dreams
Trying to cascade your heart with the pulse of someone out there
In this world on the brink of collapse, our meeting could not be a mere coincidence
Our resonating hearts lead to an even deeper love
The pain and wails of the night feast upon your dreams
But once again, a beam of light illuminates your dreams
Trying to cascade your heart with the pulse of someone out there
In this world on the brink of collapse, our meeting could not be a mere coincidence
I can feel our hearts resonating as one...
So let our voices race through the night
