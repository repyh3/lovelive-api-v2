Because everyone is here
For you and for me...
I guess it was a foregone conclusion from the moment of our birth
That we'll meet on that day, that we'll sing in this place
When a silvery breeze touches my cheek,
I feel like I can fly high in the sky (I can fly)
The dreams we drew? (They will come true!)
We are (strong!)
ONE FOR ALL (ONE FOR ALL)
ALL FOR ONE (ALL FOR ONE)
We made a promise, I will never forget it!!
I wonder what I can do for everyone? (fi-fine!)
Because you, you are (dear to me)
This is the story we're connected in, that's right
ONE FOR ALL (yes, dear)
ALL FOR ONE (yes, dear)
Because we will always, always
Be together
If this is the meaning of my birth, although I don't have a name
For which I hold on tightly, but it's dear to me, I cannot help it
I wonder what I would draw on this blank canvas?
I want to color it in fun colors (I will color it)
In this corner of the perfectly round globe
The nights when I sung when I felt down
I will surely never forget the motto!!
I remember faces of everyone (fi-fine!)
In me, in me (please, believe)
Even when you are happy, even when you want to cry, quietly,
ONE FOR ALL (yes, dear)
ALL FOR ONE (yes, dear)
Let's stand shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to shoulder, and walk forward
Thank you for always helping me out
Actually my heart is very fragile,
But to fight→to love→does that mean I'm alive?
It can get stronger now
If there is a future that I want to protect
Our journey continues (let's go)
Though it's a road with many forks (it's alright)
We laugh and sing, feeling the same
Even in a hundred years we'll still be the same
You, and only you
"I love you!"
I wonder what I can do for everyone? (fi-fine!)
Because you, you are (dear to me)
This is the story we're connected in, that's right
ONE FOR ALL (yes, dear)
ALL FOR ONE (yes, dear)
Because we will always, always
Be together
Because everyone is here
For you and for me...
