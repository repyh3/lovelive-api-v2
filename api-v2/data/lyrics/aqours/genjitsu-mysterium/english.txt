What future do you want?
SUNSHINE in the MIRROR
I want the MYSTERIUM
STARLIGHT in my SKY
My dream is a dazzling sky
SUNSHINE in the MIRROR
The rhapsody begins; mysterium from fantasy
The moment I reach out my hand
To find it, the illusion retreats
Did my heart just wake up in turmoil?
The feelings sleeping in a dark cradle
Reborn and soar up on their wings
The beautiful sky sparkles, embracing the darkness
Starlight is the searchlight of the night
Yes, I'll try to believe that they can light
The hidden door
I don't know... myself, but I'm standing in front of a mirror
And taking a good look at myself
Ah, what do I want to do?
Maybe I want to chase
More and more mysteries and dreams
Thanks to the meeting with this world
I'll try to unravel its mysteries and dreams
SUNSHINE in the MIRROR
I want the MYSTERIUM
STARLIGHT in my SKY
What can change? If you look up, the future is in motion
SUNSHINE in the MIRROR
The rhapsody begins, what do you want to change?
Mysterium from fantasy
If you get tired of the nights, you can dispel
Loneliness, which is very similar to premonition
You disappear into the gaps between time
Open its door with the shortest mental actions —
That's what I would like
I want to understand... my feelings and your feelings
I just want to touch them
Perhaps, if we unite, we can become stronger
Why do mysteries and dreams
Kindle my passion?
Even at dawn without an answer
Mysteries and dreams draw the constellations
I want to understand... my feelings and your feelings
I just want to touch them
Perhaps, if we unite, we can become stronger
I don't know... myself, but I'm standing in front of a mirror
And taking a good look at myself
Ah, what do I want to do?
Maybe I want to chase
More and more mysteries and dreams
Thanks to the meeting with this world
I'll try to unravel its mysteries and dreams
SUNSHINE in the MIRROR
I want the MYSTERIUM
STARLIGHT in my SKY
What can change?
SUNSHINE in the MIRROR
The rhapsody begins, what do you want to change?
Mysterium from fantasy
