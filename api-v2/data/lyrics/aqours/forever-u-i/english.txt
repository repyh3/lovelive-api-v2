Who are you? Answer me
Who am I? Answer me
Although I was afraid of the approaching shadow,
It was also the light, ah
Look at the future which has just begun to move
Because I'm going to take them all
Our emotions, intersecting through sound,
Let them become one
Along with a miracle
Because I live with a miracle
I'll always be okay
I'm not alone anymore
I will envelop this city with my voice
I found my new dream
Let's begin
Our never-ending story!
I would like to always be close to you,
But it's time to say goodbye
I don't have to be
Afraid of change
Because you're my light, ah
A melody that is about to end,
Let me listen to it in peace someday
Come on, smile at me with your usual smile
Let's welcome the tomorrow
Along with a miracle
Because you live with a miracle
You'll always be okay,
Right, you're not alone
We collided with each other,
So I know
You found your dream
You no longer need to hold back
Let's fulfill it according to the dictates of our hearts!
Everything starts to connect
Let's become one
Along with a miracle
Because I live with a miracle
I'll always be okay
I'm not alone anymore
I will envelop this city with my voice
I found my new dream
I am you
And you are me
Let's begin
Our never-ending story!
