The sky is shining bright
You and mint candies
Create a harmony out of timing,
Relaxingly pouring out music
I'm having so much fun right now
I enjoy every little thing
Let's escape and dance
Spin until final
Step into my heart
Also open my door with the key
Come on, let me be your star
I want to illuminate your invisible future
Even if the world ends tomorrow,
I won't regret it, and won't let you either.
(Open your eyes)
I'm too small, but I'll hug you.
I'll give you my love
A little love
A little love
A little love
A little love
Groove of cosmic mood,
Resounding with deep reverb,
Creates weightlessness that mimics swimming
Keep the rhythm continuously
It's perfect, isn't it?
We harmonize in everything, don't we?
I unconsciously coincide
With you even in speed
Can you feel my light?
I'm right here
Yes, I'm on your side
Feel me, even if we're separated
The feelings make the impossible possible
Gradually I came to know this
(Open my eyes)
Though I don't know its color or shape,
I'll give you my explosive love
A little love
A little love
A little love
A little love
Everything goes in a loop, and again in a loop
(Hello sunrise)
You look the same, but somehow special
Every time our words harmonize by chance,
Every time we laugh to tears,
It fills me up, even if it's immature, see
How shines, shines my love
Hey, I'll give it to you
A little love
A little love
A little love
A little love
