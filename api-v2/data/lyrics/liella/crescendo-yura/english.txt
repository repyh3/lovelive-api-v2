Wavering! What will
More! Happen tomorrow?
Shiny day; since the day we met
I've only been looking at you
The way you smile and sulk is completely different when it's just us
When I can't express myself,
I give up and stay silent
Even if you say we don't get along
I don't mind, (I don't at all) it's okay (Is it really?)
Umm, No No, I don't like it
Hey,
Our hearts are wavering. Why is that?
Our hearts are wavering -- they're wavering
I want to get to know you better,
But that's just my imagination
Yet
Our hearts are wavering. It may be faint
Our hearts are wavering. But things are falling into place
My eyes (crescendo) are telling me
We're more than just friends
We'll become something special... maybe
Wavering! What will
More! Happen tomorrow?
Rainy day; it's not a coincidence
We went home together that day
Amidst the sound of gentle rain, we were honest to each other for the first time
We don't have a lot in common
We're polar opposites, and yet...
The more I get to know you, the more I'm attracted to you.
Is that weird? (It might be) Is it fine? (It's totally fine!)
I can't stop it, please tell me
Hey,
Our hearts are wavering. Our feelings
Our hearts are wavering. Are the same, right?
When I turned around,
Our eyes met
So,
Our hearts are wavering. You've really been
Our hearts are wavering. Waiting for me
It's our chance to connect
I have a strange feeling
The time will come soon... maybe.
Every time I see you
My heart starts to race
What do you mean to me?
I want to find out...
Hey,
Our hearts are wavering. We're wavering
Our hearts are wavering. Just like this
I want to get to know you better
It's not just my imagination
Look,
Our hearts are wavering. It may be faint,
Our hearts are wavering. But things are falling into place
My eyes (crescendo) are telling me
We're more than just friends
We'll become something special... maybe
Wavering! What will
More! Happen tomorrow?
Surely! What will
More! Happen tomorrow?
