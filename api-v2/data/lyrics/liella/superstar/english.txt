A breeze pushes us forward
As we set off into the present, shining like superstars!!
Thank you for all the happy moments Ah
For the happiest day of my life
May our tears flow like the stars in the sky
I just want to tell you how happy I am
That we're finally together as one
A spark of radiance may still be hiding (shining)
Somewhere in these streets (sparkling)
Waiting to soar high into the sky of beginnings
(Just like we did!)
If you've ever wanted to become just like that
There's no better time to set off
You're the protagonist of your very own story
So shine bright! Shine bright!
I love everyone here so, so much
Now that we've decided to believe
It's time to run through the moment!
We'll shine like superstars!!
Thank you for all the happy moments Ah
Because you're precious, I always wish
For you to keep smiling
If we can share this feeling,
It would be so wonderful
Before the light changes (breathe)
Take a small deep breath (let's go)
Our hearts and smiles — there's still so much more
(To connect together)
I can't help but want to fly,
I hear the voice in my heart
The story we create together
Jumps high! Jumps high!
There's no end to loving as much as you want,
Let's keep going, no matter how far!
Beyond time, I'll always be right beside you
Because I met you, I found it:
The dream we can only see now
The joy of colliding with our true selves!
I'm so glad that I was born
And that's definitely not an exaggeration
After all, we managed to encounter an everyday
Filled with excitement!
I love the present so, so much
Now that we've decided to have fun
It's time to run through the moment!
We'll shine like superstars!!
All of us are superstars!!
A breeze pushed us forward
Making our hearts skip a beat
A breeze is pushing us forward!
And it's time to shine!
Because we're superstars!!
