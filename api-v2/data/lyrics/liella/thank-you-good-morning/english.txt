Let me stay asleep, a little little more
I hit the snooze button three times
Time is really one-sided!
Sometimes, it tunes in to my pace
(Hey) Stand up!
Gotta get ready and leave quickly
Raising the fader (still)
To half of the usual level
In this monochrome morning, what gives me energy
Are the words floating on the screen
I feel like it's destiny (always)
Your feeling, the meaning that reached me
So kind, Thank you Good morning
Just a single word can change a whole day
How precious Your Your Your word
No matter how casually you convey them
Your feelings resonate
Spreading sparkles
You give me give me love
I wanna give you love
When I stretch in the morning
I feel like I can do my best again, thank you!
Surfing through the crowd
In this city overflowing with Big wave
Just us passing each other by is a miracle
Laughing together is an even bigger miracle
I feel like we have a special bond
Is it too presumptuous? The same feeling
If you feel it too (I'm happy)
Your smile fills the missing parts
Let me say it, Thank you Good morning
Just a single word can change a life
Holding your your your heart
I don’t have much to give
But for my best efforts
Will you accept them?
Please let me let me know
I wanna let you know
I want to know more about you
It's so important it makes me want to cry
Tracing words with my fingertips
My heart feels fluffy
I don't really dislike my rather simple self
How about tomorrow? Will it be sparkling?
Or will it fall a bit and sting?
Even though I can’t see it yet
(Thank you today too)
Your feeling, the meaning that reached me
So kind, Thank you Good morning
Just a single word can change a whole day
How precious Your Your Your word
No matter how casually you convey them
Your feelings resonate
Spreading sparkles
You give me give me love
I wanna give you love
I tried smiling in the morning
I feel like I can do my best again, thank you!
