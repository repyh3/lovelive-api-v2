Hum... Je Je Je Jellyfish
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
An area nobody wants to enter,
Don't you have one? Why not?
You say you have talent,
But haven't you just set your borderline now?
I'm about to burst,
Innocently shooting, Bang Bang
Word can often be dangerous, like bullets!
Alright! A stun gun in the heart?
No! My weapon is dazzling innocence!
Why do you want to determine
The correct answer even for things without one?
Yeah, this feels great,
This lagoon is all mine
I'll protect it
"What kind of person are you?" Don't ask me
No matter how many times I tell you, you'll never understand
I want to remain transparent and keep floating
Let's go dancing Oh dancing
I'm completely absorbed!
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Jelly Jelly Jelly
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Jelly Jelly Jelly
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Actually, I want to be with you for a moment
What is this? What kind of rhyme is it?
Love? Friendship? It's ambiguous! Everything is unknown
Talking about pioneering passion,
Saying it's just fashion after all
Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Clearly, it's all up to you!
Please don't try to tie me down,
Nobody should
Yeah, today I'm over the moon again,
In this heaven where you can relax and have fun
I want to keep floating
"What do you want to become?" What does that mean?
Even if you ask a hundred times, you don't know how the future will be
I want to stay on the water, just floating and playing
Let's go dancing Oh dancing
Give me more
My heart floats freely, synchronized with my body
I want to keep dancing, letting time melt away like bubbles
Even if I go with the flow, I'll still be myself, Ah
Jelly...
"What kind of person are you?" Don't ask me
No matter how many times I tell you, you'll never understand
I want to remain transparent and keep floating
Let's go dancing Oh dancing
I'm completely absorbed!
