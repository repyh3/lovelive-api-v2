Have I forgotten anything? Because I'm leaving soon
Let's hold our want-to-challenge hearts with both hands
What is it that I want to draw on my ever-expanding canvas?
We light up each other's palettes, painting anything we like
You always tell me about the colors I don't know about
Let's blend the colors together to create something beautiful (sparkling-sparkling)
A map emerges from the graffiti; the time is now!
Let's go! 1.2.3! Jump towards our dreams! (Jump!)
1.2.3! Let's dive into them
Hey, my heart is beating so loud. We should all draw the future!
1.2.3! C'mon, jump! (Jump!)
1.2.3! With these feelings,
We can always make miracles happen
With the phrase 1.2.3!
I thought I lost these colorful feelings
But I found them inside my pocket, like they had been impatiently waiting for their turn
I've noticed so many things since I met you
So, I repainted these things with our happiness in mind (sparkling-sparkling)
I want to run through this world with you!
So cool! 1.2.3! Jumping with energy! (Jump!)
1.2.3! Put everything into it
Hey, I'm feeling so excited. We should all make a peace sign!
1.2.3! Keep jumping! (Jump!)
1.2.3! With an image in mind!
If you want to achieve what you love,
Connect it in 1.2.3!
1.2.3! Say it out loud
C'mon 1.2.3! Let's dive into them
Now we're all obsessed with drawing things together!
Let's go! 1.2.3! Jump towards our dreams! (Jump!)
1.2.3! With these feelings,
We can always make miracles happen
With the phrase 1.2.3!
(We'll all draw together) Let's go!
(What we love the most) The time is now!
(Everyone's thoughts) are sparkling!
(The overlapping shall START NOW!)
