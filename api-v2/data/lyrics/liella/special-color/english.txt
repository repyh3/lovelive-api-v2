Lalala lalala lalalala!
Lalala lalala lalalala!
Always living on the edge, close to my capacity
Wanting to break out of my shell! Won't forgive myself if I don't!
But I'm always the one raising the white flag, telling myself that I can't
Secretly letting out a sigh of relief
Everyone has their own color, and that's totally fine
(Ah, I can't stand it anymore!)
I keep comparing myself - no no, that's nonsense!
Not sure if I can do it, but I'll give it a try!
Time for change!
One step, and two steps, I'll set off now
Trying to convince myself that I truly am the best
One love, and two love, shout it out loud
I'll spread out my wings of love and take flight, so I'll be alright!
(Fly la! Ride on now Try la! Ride on time)
In this colorful world
(Fly la! Ride on now Try la! Ride on time)
Not having one too is a special color
I'm searching for my own identity
I want to laugh more! But I don't know how!
Ignoring the beat of my own heart,
I let my weak feelings take me for a spin
Back then, I stumbled and failed too
(Ah, I can't stand it anymore!)
But who cares about that?
What's important is the future!
I'll do it!
Three steps, and four steps, I'll keep moving
Practicing to stand proud, telling myself that I'm amazing
Three love, and four love, for every effort
My heart overflows with things I cherish!
(Fly la! Ride on now Try la! Ride on time)
If I can learn to love myself
(Fly la! Ride on now Try la! Ride on time)
Let me say it - I'm my own special color
I'm not ending things like this!!
Time to change!
One step, and two steps, I'll set off now
Evolving at high speed because I truly am the strongest
One love, and two love, shout it out loud
I'll confess my love just as I am: I want you!
(Fly la! Ride on now Try la! Ride on time)
In this colorful world
(Fly la! Ride on now Try la! Ride on time)
Not having one too is a special color
Lalala lalala lalalala!
Lalala lalala lalalala!
And this is my color!
