Jump into the new world!
My white wings dance in the purple sky, fluttering
Soon the whole city will wake up
It's so exciting,
I think I can do something better than yesterday
There is no reason for this, but I feel it
When only momentum is enough for me to move forward sharply,
Maybe it means that I already have all the cards collected
Now, when even with anxiety, which is steadily aimed at my heart all the time,
I can say: "It scares me", I have nothing more to fear!
The curtain is rising
Morning is coming; are you ready? I'm ready!
My heart is pounding, I'm sure it's dangerous
Today it will become a shining weapon, destroying the pre-established harmony
They gradually change,
My precious feelings and desires that I want to protect
I linked them, because they are always inseparable
Hey, this sky is as clear as possible
Jump into the new world!
From here begins a new future, go!!
Let's go into the new world!
Victory is for those who have fun, so jump!!
I don't want everything and everyone to fit together
Let's be unpaired, but sparkling
Laugh, when you can't help being depressed
But I'm not going to deceive you
Let's say to each other: "I love you very much"
The first step to fulfilling your dreams
Is to be able to love yourself!
Stir well, this prickly, tense atmosphere
You can't turn the negative into the positive
The moment it starts, which you're looking forward to,
Step on the border, push off from it, and don't look back again
The curtain has risen
Morning has come; are you ready? I'm ready!
My heart is pounding, I'm sure it's dangerous
Today it will become a shining weapon, destroying the pre-established harmony
Let them change,
My precious feelings and desires that I want to protect
I linked them, because they are always inseparable
Hey, this sky is as clear as possible
Jump into the new world!
From here begins a new future, go!!
Let's go into the new world!
Victory is for those who have fun, so jump!!
Jump into the new world!
