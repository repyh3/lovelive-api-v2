Before we realized it, we had come so far
With shadows entwined, at a wish's end, together we stand
Under a sky that seems as if it was made of glass
With my thoughts drifting, I sang until the sun would rise
It's not the right path, but the one that makes your heart dance
Don't lose your way, when you look back, always say
"I'll see you tomorrow" with a smile
A gentle breeze, so soft and free
Embracing you, the city, the sky, and the stars, with open arms
Someday, in a place where no one can see
I want to smile as I did before, like it's my first time
A tiny breeze blows through the air,
It grows bold, turning into a strong wind
Now, where are we heading next?
Even though we share tears, and the pain of regret
The pain you carry, will forever stay yours alone
Yet, to watch each other through every day,
That's the reason we choose to stay together
Neither time nor this heartbeat's flow
Knows the meaning of slowing down
Because in the breath-taking twilight,
I heard you say, "see you again"
A gentle breeze drifting far and wide
While still holding you, the city, the sky, and the stars
Even voices that can't find their way right now
Somewhere in the future, it will resonate
A tiny breeze, once tied with care,
It grows bold, turning into a strong wind
Keep shining, so that it doesn't fade away
The step you take with courage
Will become one with the wind
It can be anywhere (c'mon)
Go and spread it between you, the city, the sky, and the stars
A gentle breeze, drifting further and further away
Even you, the city, the sky, and the stars, are calling out to me
Someday, in a place where no one can see
I want to smile as I did before, like it's my first time
A tiny breeze blows through the air,
It grows bold, turning into a strong wind
We will turn into eternity, bound together
