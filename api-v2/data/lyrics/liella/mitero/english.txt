Ah, nothing is as it should be
It's boring, so boring
Stop giving me poor ratings, seriously!
It's not enough, not enough
Unconcealed talent + sensitivity and intelligence
Say it! (Say it) Say it! (Say it)
"Look, the miracle star is here~☆"
Just watch me, it's my turn now
(Yeah) Yeah! (Yeah)
Are you ready for the show?
Look! We're gonna change the world!
We can do it! With you and me, nothing is impossible
I don't think we should be looking to the afterlife, right?
Turn it up more! (Just you wait and see!)
Turn it up more! (Just you wait and see!)
I've never met you before... Who are you, anyway?
I'm not sure, not sure
Yes, I'm the most valuable one here
I'm totally sure, totally sure
I'm sorry to say it like that, but...
Up! (Up) Up! (Up)
It goes beyond my imagination
If you really put your mind to it, you'd understand
(Yeah) Yeah! (Yeah)
This is my real talent!
Let's see what the world can do with a spark!
You and I will present a surprise show together
I can't stop my heart from racing! An unprecedented revolution!
Turn it up more!
Hey, do you remember the promise we made? I made it to you that day
You might not remember, but I shall make it come true!
Look! We're gonna change the world!
We can do it! With you and me, nothing is impossible
I don't think we should be looking to the afterlife, right?
Turn it up more! (Just you wait and see!)
Turn it up more! (Just you wait and see!)
Turn it up more! (Just you wait and see!)
It'll happen soon!
