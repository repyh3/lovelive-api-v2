Balloons fall, beaten down by the rain
With no destination in mind
Except for their dream of being in the big sky
Because your smile shines and shimmers
I hear you wanting to go again and again!
And every single time, I become more hopeful
After the rain, we take off into the blue sky
Gently, our vivid balloons rise higher and higher!
Even if I get lost, all I have to do is close my eyes,
I can always see you still
Since it's my first time in the sky, I feel nervous and anxious
If I'm not careful, I could get swept away by the strong wind
Just when I think I can't do this,
I hear you say it'll be okay, that I can do this!
And so, I rise into the sky again
Spinning around with an airy heart
The endless blue sky stretches out before my eyes
I'm crossing over into a future that I reach out to
These precious feelings won't ever change
Since you're supporting me until the very end
I love this so much!
Even if I begin to lose all hope,
Just having you here means I can fly
I'll go even further,
Soaring high into the sky!
After the rain, let's take off into the blue sky
Gently, our vivid balloons rise higher and higher!
Even if I get lost, all I have to do is close my eyes,
I can always see you still
I'll embrace my wish as we fly into the sky
(La-la-la-la) let's (la-la-la-la) dream
(La-la-la-la) let's (la-la-la-la) dream!
