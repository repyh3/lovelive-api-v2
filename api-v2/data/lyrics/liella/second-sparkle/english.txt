I'll never forget the moment
Where my hand reached out towards you
Even though my message to you never reached,
It's still a miracle, anyway, that I met you
Tomorrow will be yesterday
It's like a dizzying experience
The intersection that turned blue,
I shouted to my immobile heart
"What fun is a future that doesn't scare you?"
If we are to move forward, we must remain strong
It's not about "I want to make it come true", I will definitely make it come true
I'll turn every flaw and tear of mine into a gleam of light
I'll keep going, so believe in me
I'm chanting my wish to a distant star;
That wish is "I want to see this to the end with you..."
The town is quiet at midnight
Only my voice echoes
I'm not as weak as I thought I was
I was there. Hey, listen to me
"How can there be a dream that isn't painful?"
I keep pushing forward, but I'm worried that I'm falling behind
However, I mustn't give up; If I am to reach my dream,
Then I've decided to make a second miracle happen here!
Open up a new future with your own hands
If you can be strong enough, you'll really change
It's not about "I want to make it come true", I will definitely make it come true
I'll turn every flaw and tear of mine into a gleam of light
I'll keep going, so believe in me
The first time that I touched it;
It burst into life, over and over again
The feeling that I love you;
It'll let me believe forever
