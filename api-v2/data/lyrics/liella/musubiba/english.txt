Once again, the petals drift away on their journey
And a growing restlessness quietly builds in my chest
These days, I've been slowly overcoming my awkwardness
It's as if I'm keeping in step with the seasons
The path keeps going on, and if you listen
There are so many footsteps beside me, overlapping as we go
I've been doing well, I wonder if this will reach you?
I gently entrusted my feelings to the wind
The young leaves that were once fluttering in the wind are now
Looking so happy even amidst all of the commotion
There are so many things I'm interested in!
There are so many goals I've already achieved
Let's aim even higher and dream big together
Because, when shared with someone else, it becomes a wonderful journey
I'm surrounded by many people who give me strength
They're all so warm and dependable
Even the rustling young leaves grow louder with life
Gathering light as they play the music that this life gave them
Wave your hand in the clear blue sky
The wind replies with a gentle breeze
I've been going well, and I've been smiling too
I want to stay connected forever even amidst all of the commotion
