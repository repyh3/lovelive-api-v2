Even though things aren't always fun
When you accomplish them, you feel a hundred times happier
Even if it makes us cry sometimes, let's butt heads with all we've got
Just like the sky we always see is blue
Don't worry about it! Mistakes are an invitation to grow
Now, let's move on to the next step
Here we go! Right now!
We're all going to keep our heads up and stand up
We'll make an upwards trend as many times as we want
Yeah, let's create it (Go!!) jump on it (Go!!) and shoot for the stars
Let's embrace that prickly pain
Because we can believe in it, this sparkling future
Should definitely be waiting for us
Go!! Restart
Go!! Yeah
Someone's happy face is better than my own
The desire to protect others is what makes me strong
Let's put it into words! Just a flash gives way to inspiration
The next melody is already being written
You too! Wake up!
If you listen to our voices, you'll suddenly notice it
This moment goes at a high-speed pace
Yeah, hurry up (Go!!) take a leap of faith (Go!!) and take on the challenge
The thorn in our backs pushes us forward
It's a signal that has changed more than now
We can go further than we've ever done before
We might as well dream big
We may get covered in mud, but we'll keep encouraging each other
We'll shine the brightest in this world!
We're all going to keep our heads up and stand up
We'll make an upwards trend as many times as we want
Yeah, let's create it (Go!!) jump on it (Go!!) and shoot for the stars
Let's embrace that prickly pain
Because we can believe in it, this sparkling future
Should definitely be waiting for us. That's right!
We'll keep going while holding hands
Go!! Restart
Go!! Yeah
Go!! Yeah
Go!! Yeah
