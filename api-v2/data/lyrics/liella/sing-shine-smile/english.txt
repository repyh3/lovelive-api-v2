Sing! Let's sing together; Smile! Let's connect our hearts
Shine! Let's make them shine; Smile! These stars filled with smiles
Even if I could go anywhere
In the past or the future
I'm sure I'd still be right here
I'm going to reflect upon this moment with you
These small twinkles
Meet one after another
And goes beyond fun
After being hurt, I found out
How to have more fun
I'm just dreaming, I'm totally obsessed
So much so that I forget to sleep
You don't need a reason to fall in love
I realized that
Even if there are nights where we can't see a thing
Let's gather our courage and try to smile
That sparkle should still get through
Our smiles sparkle
Come on, everyone, sparkle
I wanted to tell you this
My pen moved swiftly over the paper
As if it was for the first time
The world was smiling like we had just met
Even those faraway twinkles
I feel like I can reach out and grab them
When something strange happens
We suddenly burst into laughter
It's dazzling at any time
We can do more, yes we can
I can't help but feel excited
I won't forget the joy of being connected to you
Our smiles sparkle
Look, I'm sparkling with you
We were put under a spell
By a magic known as a dream
Time goes by, but it never ends
It won't break until the day our dreams come true
Nothing can stop us now
This is what we've been dreaming of
You don't need a reason to fall in love
Because I realized it
Even if there are nights where we can't see a thing
Let's gather our courage and try to smile
That sparkle should still get through
Our smiles sparkle
Come on, everyone, sparkle
Sing! Let's sing together; Smile! Let's connect our hearts
Shine! Let's make them shine; Smile! These stars filled with smiles
