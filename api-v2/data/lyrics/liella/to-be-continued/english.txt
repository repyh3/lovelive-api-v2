I've been staring at the calendar all day
I've got no time for this
Because we can't give up on anything
Don't sleep, let's dream
(It never stops!)
Curiosity is the beginning
(Let's have a try!!)
Be brave, and a miracle will come true
Even when we reach the top, the journey won't ever end
(It looked like the finish line) but it was only the start line
We'll keep running with you, over and over again
(Until we reach the end) we'll keep holding hands
When I added a new line to the staff
A melody I didn't know about twinkled
Don't search for the answer
It's up to us to make a decision now
(More!)
That moment of excitement,
(Just moving on!!)
Let's leave it in the hands of the future
It's about to start, an episode without a name
(My heart flutters) it's a little nerve-racking
It'll be okay, I believe in our strong bond
(Follow me) when I throw the go sign up into the sky
(It never stops!)
We'll keep on coming back
(Let's have a try!!)
Our passionate feelings are to be continued
Even when we reach the top, the journey won't ever end
(It looked like the finish line) but it was only the start line
We'll keep running with you, over and over again
(Until we reach the end) we'll keep holding hands
