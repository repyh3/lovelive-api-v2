It’s youth! Don’t be sluggish!
(1, 2, 3!)
Failures don't matter at all
Even if you complain, "Ugh, this is the worst..."
In the end, you'll just laugh, right?
(Everything is the best, isn't it?)
Even with preparation, it's never perfect
But passion is the one thing we're fully ready with
With zero chance of winning, we say, "Alright, let's go!"
Let's get excited
Heart pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding...
Say! Yeah!
I don't want to regret not trying
Going my way
Whether it's a mistake or not
It's something only you can decide
It's youth, so let's do whatever we want
We declare:
We won't slack off for even a second
We'll enjoy it seriously until the very end
We're gonna shine the brightest
Jump up on three!
With an upbeat tune, let's break through
Hey, it's time to smash that stopper
Because we're HOPPERS
It's youth, don't be sluggish!
(I wanna have fun with you!)
1. No reason, but we jump high
2. Dash down a long, long slope
3. Getting soaked in the rain, laughing like crazy
(We wanna do all that, don't we?)
(Pa pa pa) Switch it up
(Pa pa pa) Let's be flexible
It's a loss if you don't try! (Try everything from the start!)
Excitement, excitement, excitement...
Say! Yeah!
Even neatly lined-up musical notes
Let's draw freely
It's okay to ignore them
Because freedom is unstoppable, right?
It'll work out somehow — this is youth
We declare:
We'll boldly dream right now
Even crying is proof of trying your best
Let's be proud of ourselves the most
Jump up on three!
Anyway, just give it your all
Even if you're a coward
You can absolutely change
In the moment you're doing something you love, you're strong, right?
Surely, "living youth" means just that
We're always jumping around
Making a big fuss
Every single moment is sparkling
The memories we worked up a sweat for
Both tears and smiles
Are all brighter than any jewel!
(They're shining!)
Let's do whatever we want, this is youth
We declare:
We won't slack off for even a second
We'll enjoy it seriously until the very end
We're gonna shine the brightest
Let's get hurt, this is youth
We declare:
We won't hesitate for even a second
We'll be serious from start to finish
We'll shine the brightest
Let's change the ordinary tomorrow
Jump up on three!
With an upbeat tune, let's break through
Hey, it's time to smash that stopper
Because we're HOPPERS
Anyway, just give it your all
Let's do all the things we want to do
It's youth! Don't be sluggish!
We are the Youth HOPPERS
