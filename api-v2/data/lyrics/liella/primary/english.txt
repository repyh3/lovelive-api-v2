Sunlight filters through the leaves
I hum a newly learned melody
When I falter, your voice fades in gently
As if its lending me support
An encounter in a new season
Feels familiar for some reason?
They seem to multiply as time passes
These precious melodies of ours
The sparkling pages, scattered by the wind
What scenes will we paint on them?
A flower blooms amidst our light
As I gaze up towards the sky
Splashes of water plays in the sunlight
Fairly close to the bench we're sitting on
Let's talk aimlessly
About you and me
Filling these pages with my favorite words
It's becoming quite the unpredictable color
Flowers start to bloom one after the other
As I dream about what tomorrow will bring
The sparkling pages, scattered by the wind
Flipping them over so I won't ever forget
Instead of bookmarking it, I'll continue to sing
The song of our beginnings
Our days sway gently in the breeze
What scenes will we paint on them?
A flower changes color amidst our light
As I gaze up towards the sky
As I gaze up towards the sky, bathing in its light
