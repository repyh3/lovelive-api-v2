There's no such thing as a limit
Emotions are rising, this is the moment
Now Now Now Now
Isn't it too late? Tomorrow just won't do
Right Right Right Right
With the zap of intuition that just hit me,
I try to get out
But these hands and feet move on their own
I loved and trusted you, no, I don't want this
No matter how many doors I've opened, I still feel unfulfilled
This sense of accomplishment isn't enough, and that's why I can keep moving forward
If nothing else stays with me then my experience will be my only ally
Nothing I've done was ever for nothing
Listen to my heartbeat
Maze; I don't want to easy way out, I'd rather keep my pride and get lost
Ways; I've been finding my own
Rise beyond the shining stars
Shining stars
Rise beyond the shining stars
We aspire to rise even higher
That's not all you've got, so reach for the top
I don't want a calm tomorrow, I crave the fire
I want to burn with passion, feeling that heartbeat with you
Now Now Na Na
Shout it and let your voice ring out loud
I'm not here for pretty words or sugar-coated lies
Right Right Ra Ra
If you're going to place your fingers on my heart
Everything, all of me is the right answer
The more that you carve at it, the more your heart will shine
It's like a jewel so bright that I can't look away for even a second
Smiles and tears shine brighter because they constrast each other
Now that I finally understand
Future, come on over
Chase; I've been searching for something that no one else has
Phrase; I've finally gotten down the words
Rise beyond the shining stars
We aspire to reach even higher
What I want right now is a reason for living
I just can't keep flying on my own anymore
I can feel it, this connection with you
We won't be together forever,
But our hands are connected now saying "we are"
I can rewrite what's possible and impossible
That's kind of unstoppable, isn't it?
Why wouldn't you think you're one of a kind?
Don't ever get used to being compared
Get back, get back
Let's take your power back
Even when life throws you into hard mode,
Rise above it, and set a new record
Break out, break out
Everybody! Break out now!!
We aspire to rise even higher
I don't want tomorrow to be the same as yesterday
Let's go from here together!
We aspire to rise even higher
That's not all you've got, so reach for the top
I don't want a calm tomorrow, I crave the fire
I'll never let go of this pounding heartbeat
Ah, yeah
