I wanted to leave my current feelings behind, so I traced them on your hand
I wrote "I love you" with my fine-tipped pen
That ticklish grin of yours made me giggle inside
So I kept on doodling, sketching you, again and again
The voice of the evening cicadas say: "Summer is ending soon"
Even though the air is starting to grow cold, my heart still remains so hot
I always want to be laughing with you,
Want to keep dancing, there's not enough time
With a laugh, I threw on my sunglasses,
Sunset skies reflected in the lens. I guess it's time to head home!
I feel like we've become more alike than before
Not in terms of likes or dislikes, but the atmosphere between us
Or maybe, we just blended into one!
Just like that, you're always right by my side,
You're shining, and you're so precious to me
Tears filled my eyes the moment I told you,
But, just for today, I'll blame it on the sunset
Even if a dazzling future is waiting for me
Right now is what I treasure the most
That blazing orange is like the sky caught fire
I just want to keep looking at you more and more
I always want to be laughing with everyone,
Want to keep dancing, so let's meet again tomorrow
With a laugh, I threw on my sunglasses,
Let's put them in the desk because it's time to head home!
Even for the ordinary days, just by being together
They can be turned into something special
The days I spend with you will go on forever
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and beyond
The days we've shared together, will never truly end
As long as my heart keeps wishing for it - they'll keep going!
