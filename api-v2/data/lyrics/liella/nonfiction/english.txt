Hey, I want to smile more
I want to be more honest
Hey, I want to shine now
That feeling ends here
Hey, don't just complain
'Cause I'll light you up right now
And once I've grasped your hand
I'll never let it go
I'll prove to you
There's no such thing as impossible
I'll break down your poker face
And captivate you
Let's sing!
I'll take you to a world you've never seen before
A splendid wonderland, starting now
Fantastic! Amazing! But this is nonfiction!!
Let's open a new door
Do Da Da Follow me
Do Da Da Real live yeah!
Do Da Da Follow me
Do Da Da Love me do!
I want to be complicated more
I know just how you feel
I want to be accepted more
I want so many things
Then you've gotta change yourself first
Just wanting things is naive
Hey, look at me living from now on
With no hesitation
I'll dance a showy Charleston
Don't forget to be playful
You're entranced too, don't you know?
Pour your heart into it
Get down!
I don't want to miss a single moment
I'm riding so high on signs of good things
Oh happy! So dreamy! But this is nonfiction!!
Let's start the show
Let me hear your voice
Move your body, too
A next-level trinity
I want to be one with you
Everybody gathers into a circle
Now it's party time
Get fired up
Again and again
Adults and bambinas calling out
Let's sing!
I'll take you to a world you've never seen before
I'll make a wonderland now with my own hands
Fantastic! Amazing! But this is nonfiction!!
Let's open a new door
Do Da Da Follow me
Do Da Da Real live yeah!
Do Da Da Follow me
Do Da Da Love me do!
Do Da Da Follow me
Do Da Da Real live yeah!
Do Da Da Follow me
Do Da Da Love me do!
