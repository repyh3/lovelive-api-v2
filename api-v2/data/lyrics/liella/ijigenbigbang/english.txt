Wow wow, let's go together and see,
Wow wow, our destination.
L! O! L! L! O! L! L! O! L! O! L O! L!
Yes! What a great meeting this is!
Our hearts and voices shouldn't have crossed,
But in this moment (our voices) our dreams overlap (oh yes!)
Our hearts will surely be filled with passion.
This is excellent! Huge wave! Come to our show time.
My love (I LOVE) and your love are here, and you are here too.
Because there is nothing that can't come true,
Let's make our dreams come true.
If you squeeze my hand tightly, I will be filled with courage.
Like beautiful blooming flowers,
Our words now
Begin to illuminate us gently and reliably.
We will envelop this whole world with this song
And not let go again.
We promise you, so follow us!
When the light from thousands of stars comes together
And becomes one, the colors of us all
Are connected, it's so beautiful!
Let them never subside, until the very future,
Our melodious voices that will sound forever.
Even (even) further,
I feel like I can fly to you.
Wow wow, let's go together and see (want to know?)
Wow wow, our destination.
Let's make this an exciting journey.
Life is almost nothing but kiss and cry.
What happens (tomorrow) and today is a surprise.
Joyful and cheerful things,
I want to give them all to you.
If I reach out my hand as much as possible, I will reach someone.
We walked through the history
That we carve.
Our possibilities (are limitless)
They are infinite (infinity)
We are rewriting a new page.
We still can't stop, so follow us!!
The power of another dimension makes our hearts beat faster.
We are filled with curiosity
About how far we can go!
I will never forget it, until the very future,
This view will be a memorial for me.
Even for a moment (for a second)
It's like a treasure to me.
LaLaLa LaLaLa
Let's cherish it, let's sing with love.
Our circle is getting bigger and bigger.
We dance, we dance, raising a new wind.
Hey, this is the first time I've had this premonition.
It's like a miracle...!
L! O! L! L! O! L! L! O! L! O! L O! L!
When the light from billions of stars comes together
And becomes one, the colors of us all
Are connected, it's so beautiful!
Let them never subside, until the very future,
Our melodious voices that will sound forever.
Even (even) further,
I feel like I can fly to you.
Wow wow, I love you (I want to scream)
Wow wow, I want to tell this to you, you and you.
Wow wow, let's go together and see,
Wow wow, our dazzling, dazzling destination.
