The hottest time of the year is here once again
With no one knowing what this year will bring
It's time to leap right out of the classroom
Right into the embrace of the bright blue sky
A rainbow emerges from the spray of a hose
Heading right toward you as you desperately try to flee
We'll have more fun today than we ever had as kids
Because now we're free to fly
Let's do all the things we love, but what should we do first?
So excited, I just can't wait, my heart's pounding, body shaking
All at once, too!
We're flying fish jumping under the summer sun
When I'm with you, I can fly anywhere I want
I can't wait to share this feeling in my heart with you
So put on the widest smile the world's ever seen, for all to see!
It's as if time has stopped
You can hear a brass band playing in the distance
Raise a toast with ice cream and ramune
It's a such a nice, quiet afternoon
Let's go to the beach, the pool, and see fireworks too
Just talking about it makes this feel festive
When should we do it? Today?
Let's make it all happen
It's okay to be so excited, to the pointing of rolling around
So happy, very softly, we're giggling, roaring with laughter
That's what we want
We're flying fish passing under the summer sun
Let's chase after that blazing sunlight!
Our hands and feet are sunburnt, and our cheeks sting
But when we laugh together, it's the best time ever
Where do you think the clouds are going?
They're being carried away by the wind
We're so carefree, but that's what makes it fun
What will we do tomorrow?
We're flying fish jumping under the summer sun
When I'm with you, I can fly anywhere I want
I want to share that feeling in my heart with you
So put on the dazzling smile the world's ever seen, for all to see!
C'mon, let's go! It's summer!
