Retracing the steps of the memories we made together
We sure laughed and cried a whole lot along the way
After overcoming all sorts of challenges
Our hearts are now connected as one
Look up and you'll see
That even the stars are twinkling
Like they're calling out to one another
The very thing that I've always held dear in my heart
Our dreams, the blossoms of our dreams, now bloom bright
Filled with the radiance we now hold
We'll set off on a brand new journey
On days when I couldn't believe in myself
I would run because I believed in you
I kept stopping and repeating this all over again
But I do think I'm getting stronger
Hey, from here on out,
I wonder what kind of future
Is waiting for us?
I know we can go even further
Our dreams, the blossoms of our dreams, are blooming again
I'll never let go of your hand again
We'll set off on a journey together
Even if we can't see the future,
We'll keep heading out
As hope will light the way. C'mon now.
Our story will continue forevermore.
Embracing the dreams we hope to see come true
Our dreams, the blossoms of our dreams, we'll make them bloom
Filled with the radiance we now hold
We'll set off on a brand new journey
We'll set off on a journey to make our dreams come true
We're going, we're going to make them bloom.
We're going, we're going to make them bloom.
