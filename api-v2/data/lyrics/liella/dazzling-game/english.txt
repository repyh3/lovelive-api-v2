This unwavering spirit within me
Is second to none
I'll forge the path to the top
With nothing but my bare hands!
My desire to win burns strong
And I've got the skills to match
The days of my youth aren't just for show
They burn, and burn, bright for all to see
Being perfectly in sync
Will forever be our pride
Heading to the top as one
Without ever forgetting the path we took!
There's an unforgettable story
Behind all the "can"s and "cannot"s
We've always been one,
With the answer in our grasp all this time
The kindness that only you possess
The passion that only you possess
If we had that in our grasp, we'd surely be the best
The time has come to link up these sparkling pieces of you and I
To encounter a future brighter than we've ever seen
We're a puzzle shining for all to see as our hearts start to beat
We'll go beyond the us of yesterday, glowing brighter than before
As we become one,
We're finally at the true start line
We'll never be apart ever again
It's time to take off!
Why did I always felt something was missing?
The answer to that question was you
The moment I realized it, I instinctively reached out
And took your hand in mine
Listen closely, there's a tiny sound,
As excitement begins to bloom. Surely,
You feel the same thrill, don't you?
I somehow just know it
This isn't mere familiarity — it's resonance
This isn't just a game — it's proof
We're serious, and together we can fly
I'll help you find that piece you haven't discovered yet
Before they're covered in dust without you even noticing
Even if you're not confident yet, hold your head high and offer it boldly
Just loving something is enough to mean you've been chosen.
The sparkle that shines again,
What will it reveal when we connect it?
It's thrilling, isn't it?
Let's reach out for it!
The more we polish ourselves,
The more pieces we'll gain
The puzzle keeps growing bigger,
And so does our dream
How far can we go?
It's a game where no one knows the answer
But one thing's for sure — it'll get even more exciting
And we'll shine even brighter!
The time has come to link up these sparkling pieces of you and I
All this time we've been captivated by these ever-changing shapes and colors
We're a puzzle shining for all to see as our hearts start to beat
We'll go beyond the us of yesterday, glowing brighter than before
As we become one,
We're finally at the true start line
We'll never be apart ever again
Now that we've become one
We'll never be apart ever again
It's time to take off!
Wow...
