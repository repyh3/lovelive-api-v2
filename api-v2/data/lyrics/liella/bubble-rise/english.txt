Listen to the voices
Hope is a bubble,
Always rising up towards the sky
Even if the path ahead looks pitch black,
All you have to do is look up
If it bursts, we're crying
And yet I'm wishing it wouldn't disappear
My love for it will always be the source of my strength
That's why I can't give up on my dream
No matter where I am nothing can stop my overflowing dreams
Bubble rise
Reach your hands out towards the light
I'll throw away even my sense of shame to make my dreams come true
Even if I never find it in my grasp
I'll never stop fighting, there's nothing to be embarrassed about
Even while swaying, look up
Even while sparkling, at the sky
Our hopes never stop rising towards the sky
Every stumble awakens yet another bout of longing
That's why there's no reason to be afraid
Just keep reaching out towards the light
Back when I could innocently express my feelings in words
Those childhood days are so far away
Nobody cared then
Whether I could do it or why I did it
Let's try, we're trying
Let's promise like we did then
Nodding at each other in agreement, we're already very happy
Newly born lights,
They must fly faster, never sinking.
Bubble rise
The light invites me:
"Don't look down, look only up"
I'll make friends with my insecurities
Fear is a growing force
The day, when hope disappears from my heart, will never come.
Even if I fell to the bottom of the water, I would be sure
That this is not the end, but everything begins from here.
Swaying and sparkling
It rises forever
Swaying and sparkling
I can see the future
Reach your hands out towards the light
I'll throw away even my sense of shame to make my dreams come true
I want to keep struggling with all my might,
Until I can praise myself
Bubble rise
Reach your hands out towards the light
Like a little child to make my dreams come true
Even if I never find it in my grasp
I'll never stop fighting, there's nothing to be embarrassed about
Even while swaying, look up
Even while sparkling, at the sky
Our hopes never stop rising towards the sky
Every stumble awakens yet another bout of longing
That's why there's no reason to be afraid
Just keep reaching out towards the light
