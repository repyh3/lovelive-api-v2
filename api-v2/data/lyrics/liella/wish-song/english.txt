Sing along with me
I felt it the day I met you
The feeling of wanting to make my dreams come true has been swelling up inside me (Starting day)
Even with your trembling hands, you made sure it wouldn't disappear
The thing you've been squeezing on to, we'll protect it together
The dazzling morning sunshine and the sudden passing rain
As long as we're smiling by each other's side, even these become irreplaceable moments
Those warm passions you hold within your heart
We'll tie them to the 5 lines of a musical staff, and make them resonate across the blue sky
Tears just don't suit you anymore
Let's move on together and keep on believing
No matter what time it is, our Wish Song will give us courage
Even if you think it's impossible
As long as you face forward, you'll see that your dream will be in the distance
Always waiting for you
I'll repeat it with you no matter how many times, the harmony carrying our wishes
We'll make sure of the happy excitement we share standing here
Our connected hearts will never come undone
We'll bounce along the 5 lines of a musical staff, and if you run and fall down sometimes
I'll come after you, because you're not alone
With everyone's voice, our story will continue
It'll never be disrupted, our Wish Song carries the wind
A melody of hope that I heard one day
It created the wonderful present we live in
Let's hold it closely as we take it along with us
On the 5 lines of a musical staff
Our futures are tied together, overflowing with light
That's right, a smile is what suits you best
Let's move on together and keep on believing
No matter what time it is, our Wish Song will give us courage
