What is "kindness"?
I'm worried you may have made a mistake
Soon, my feelings will get in the way
It'll be very confusing from your perspective
I had it before I realized I did
Standing underneath the streetlights, can I have it for a little longer?
I want to say that I love you,
But words aren't enough
I want to be a flower that soothes
Your loneliness on the way home
Crouching down as we talk a lot
We laugh together as our toes become numb
Maybe this is nothing out of the ordinary
But it's something to support you in your time of need
I stay by your side, even if you stumble
Until you start walking down that path by yourself
I want to say that I cherish you
But words aren't enough
I want to be a flower that smiles
When we reach a crossroad
I'll become stronger to protect you
For my own dreams, for those important to me
I want to say that I'll do my best
But words aren't enough
No matter what, I won't lose
I'll keep pushing forwards
To say that I love you
I don't need to say anything at all
I'll give you a gentle push from behind
I'll become a flower that blooms with dignity
I'll become a flower that thinks of you
