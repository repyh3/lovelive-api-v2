The feelings that don't show in my eyes,
How can I inform you about them?
What happens, if I convey them to you?
I delineate my favorite things
With a tear line, so they don't get damaged
There are times when you can't just help but cry
I understood this, although I wouldn't like to understand
The resolution of my eyes is so high,
That I had to close them
My eyelids are illuminated by roadside lights
I wish I could just dream,
Remaining as innocent as ever
The feelings that I swallowed sharply,
Being painted in the color of tears, there were so many,
That when they disappeared, left unvoiced, everything became so blue
But, when suddenly I was rocked by the waves,
You smiled at me again
Rather than look at yesterday, I'll fix my eyes straight ahead,
To be able to enjoy this limited time
What I always wanted was to hear the familiar words:
"Let's go somewhere together sometime"
I'm always so selfish, that I can't speak out
Because of the philosophy that's ingrained in me
But now I don't think
I should hold myself back anymore
I shake off my sad premonition,
Because I saw a star in your eyes
You can feel it too, it's so blue
What a strange color it has,
If only you could see it
Even if you're by my side, you don't know
That I have pain that I can't share with you
But I feel like I can change now
The feelings that I swallowed sharply,
Being painted in the color of tears, there were so many,
That when they disappeared, left unvoiced, everything became so blue
But the moment I was suddenly able to speak,
You smiled at me again
