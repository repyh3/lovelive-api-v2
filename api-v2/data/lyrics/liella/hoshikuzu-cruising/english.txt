Stay with me tonight, please
You're one step ahead of me before I can say anything
I can't wait to see you; time is running out
Everything's a shooting star;
Surely, I am to not miss this moment
When I turn around,
I see you've arrived, welcome!
Someday, the morning will come
I know, I know
But...
Stay with me just a little while longer
I'm dreaming of a stardust cruise
I reach towards the sparkle
That connects me with you
Oh, swim in the stars!
I'll decide if I can't do it or not
I'm more amazing than you can imagine
I can be stronger; I can aim higher
I've been doing it one millimeter at a time
The stars of my dreams
Twinkle in the distance
Someday, I'll be able to see them again
I'm sure, I'm sure
Believe...
I've finally arrived at this day
It's not a dream, it's a stardust cruise
Weaving through the gaps of meteor showers
I'm fluttering with you
Oh, sing to the stars!
Wow! How wonderful
Let's make a little magic
That I want to be a memory
You don't want it to, though
I know, I know
But, hey...
Stay with me just a little while longer
I'm dreaming of a stardust cruise
I reach towards the sparkle
That connects me with you
Oh, swim in the stars!
Swimming with you, more!
I want to be with you forever and forever
