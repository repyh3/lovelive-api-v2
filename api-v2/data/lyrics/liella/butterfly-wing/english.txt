I crawl through
This darkness
The moonlight that could disappear
At any moment is my guide
Where we stand
Makes me wonder what I was born for?
It's affecting my mind
The roaring of the wind,
I screamed to drown it out
I've always known about
The sad truth of this sacred world
The more opponents I have to fight
The more my heart is gently polished and starts to shine
Even without wings, I can fly
I will summon a butterfly into my soul
And even higher than that bird up high
I will cast blinding colors as I fly into the sky
The only ones who will be chosen
Are those who wish strongly enough
One day, it screamed so loudly as a signal;
The thunder and rain combined together
With it destroying the ground below
The fire in my heart still continues to burn fiercely
A flock of birds take flight
Inviting me to go to the shade of the rocks
I don't need gentle whispers
Since I can follow the voice of the butterfly
No one needs to know the reason
Whenever I was alone, I cried, but now I fly high into the sky
I shall soar
How about you take flight with me;
You can do it, can't you?
Even without wings, I can fly
I will summon a butterfly into my soul
And even higher than that bird up high
I will cast blinding colors as I fly into the sky
The only ones who will be chosen
Are those who wish strongly enough
