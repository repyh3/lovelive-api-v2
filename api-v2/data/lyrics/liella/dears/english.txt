Every little thing forms a drop of happiness
I can feel it in my heart
Even when things don't go too well, and there are days when I feel down,
I'll keep looking towards the future, no matter what
Always having someone smiling right beside me
Makes me want to bring a smile to everyone I meet
The seed of kindness blooming in my heart
That's right, it's because we're connected, no matter where we are
There are all kinds of emotions that I can't hold onto
With just my two bare hands
On those days when I feel helpless, and tears threaten to spill from my eyes,
Someone will be by my side to gently embrace me
Should there be someone who lost their way by my side
It would be nice if I could share my warmth with them
The day this seed of kindness started blooming in my heart
That's right, it's because I can hear your voice, no matter where you are
I've only just noticed that everyone around me is so kind.
Love blooms in the midst of compassion
Always having someone smiling right beside me
Has me bring a smile to those I'm thankful of
The seeds of these flowers blooming in my heart
That's right, I'm going to show them to you
Wait for me...
