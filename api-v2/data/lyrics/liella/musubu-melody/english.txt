As the path before us transforms into the color of spring
We'll run along it just like we did that day
Today is the day we set off on a new journey
And we'll set off with nothing but hope in our hearts
In this very place where there was once nothing
Rings the melody we wrote together
It will surely never disappear
And continue shining for all time
The cherry blossoms sing for all to hear
As we begin to soar towards a brand-new sky
This isn't a goodbye, we'll meet again one day
So I'll send you off
With a smile on my face, congratulations
We stumbled and cried so many times
A song about the shine we created
Will one day come to a complete stop
It will surely light up this dark world
I'm glad that I was lucky enough to meet you all
The melody that we put together note by note,
It will surely never disappear
It will always be here
I’m waiting for you to come back
Let's soar beyond the stars
This isn't a goodbye, you're precious to me
So I'll send you off
With these words, congratulations
With these wings (we will soar) into the distance
A melody that
Connects us all forever
(Shining melody)
The cherry blossoms sing for all to hear
As we begin to soar towards a brand-new sky
This isn't a goodbye, we'll meet again one day
So I'll send you off
With a smile on my face, congratulations
(To the future)
Let's embrace our memories and fly away
This isn't a goodbye, I love you
So I'll send you off
With these words, congratulations
Our hearts will always be one
