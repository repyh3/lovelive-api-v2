My small shoulders shook
As I felt the cold wind
Memories come and go
All the time, all the time
There was a starry sky in my heart
Hope was, tomorrow was shining so bright
I always thought
I could make miracles happen
Back then, no matter how fast we ran,
We still couldn't reach it
We may have fallen down and cried a lot,
But I came to like myself a little bit more
If I listened carefully,
I could hear the sound of an approaching train
Sometimes I'd stop and watch it go past
All the time, all the time
I couldn't believe in myself
But when I heard you say that
I could do it for the first time
I started to have faith in myself
Someday, I won't be able to overcome this
Will there come a day when I'll tremble in regret?
But even so, I can't erase it
This starry sky shining within me
Starlight...
Let's go as far as we can
Back then, no matter how fast we ran,
We still couldn't reach it
We may have fallen down and cried a lot,
But I've come to like myself more than before
