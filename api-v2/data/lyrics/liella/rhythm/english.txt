With each breath of this brand-new air
It's like I'm being born again
Now, step 1: Tune up your mind
Next, step 2: Get moving
The left over raindrops are glistening
It's starting to unravel (the tangled gloom inside)
Even the strings on my hoodie join the dance
It's not something difficult (just go with the music)
Let's turn up the volume on this excitement, let's ride!!
The rhythm won't stop, it's continuing on into tomorrow
It's sparkling and dazzling (with a rhythm always inside)
The scenery that passes us by (with a swaying rhythm)
I'll make my dreams come true and overcome any doubts
I can do it because it's me (with a rhythm always inside)
I will run with the belief that things will go my way (I carve each step as I go my way)
I suppose that nothing in this world lasts forever
Not even the blue sky, or this body of mine
Now, tap 1: Start to stomp your feet
Next is tap 2: Move with a spring in your step
It's a fun move that pulls in a happy feeling
I want to see them again (those shadows lined up side by side)
But I still need a little more training
I'm really not lonely or anything (because we're always together)
Now, it's time to retie your shoelaces, come on, let's try!!
The rhythm is inviting me to somewhere farther than tomorrow
I'll only look forward (with a rhythm always inside)
Soaking in the morning sun (with the rhythm I share with you)
I will never lose these feelings that I hold dear to me
I can do my best now (with a rhythm inside, by my side)
Let's pick up the speed even more (keep carving and go your way)
I can now proudly say "I'm right here" with my head held high
Yeah, day by day
The courage I've gathered piece by piece, now shines bright like a diamond
The rhythm won't stop, it's continuing on into tomorrow
It's sparkling and dazzling (with a rhythm always inside)
The scenery that passes us by (with a swaying rhythm)
I'll make my dreams come true and overcome any doubts
I can do it because it's me (with a rhythm always inside)
Look, the future is smiling (it can't end, so go my way)
