Keep on smiling, yes!
Keep on dreaming, forever!
All those things that I couldn't do alone
Knowing everyone's counting on me, I'll do my best
Turning the volume of my heart as high as it goes
I'll write your precious voice and mine into this song
When putting our dreams into words (our dreams into words), never giving up is the rule
Even little me can give birth to an enormous power
Spreading throughout me!
We'll connect everyone with your sparkling smile
If we share this happiness in our hearts, we can surely fly all the way to space
With your never-ending love, I'll give going even further a try
How much I love you, how happy I feel
I'll tell you everything without a trace of hesitation
And step onto our next stage with a smile
Keep on smiling, yes!
Keep on dreaming, forever!
It's okay to get hurt sometimes and hang your head low
Let's create a place together
Where we can accept everything
I'll pack my suitcase, cramming it full of everything
Excitement, burning passion, whatever I want
Let's take it all with us!
Let's strive to outshine the stars with a radiant smile
As long as I can laugh, I'll move forward no matter how many times I stumble
Dreams never end — the wind is blowing, so I'll fly
How thrilled I am, how happy I feel
Because I have the version of me I want to be
It's a miracle you've given me — thank you
So many feelings (you gave me so many)
I'll return them one by one (every smile, every ounce of courage)
Now, let's tie it all together
This happiness in our hearts, and the times we cried and laughed together
With your never-ending love, I'll see it through and try
How much I love you, how happy I feel
Now that I've told you everything, I won't hesitate anymore
Let's step onto our stage
Keep on smiling, yes!
Keep on dreaming, forever...!
