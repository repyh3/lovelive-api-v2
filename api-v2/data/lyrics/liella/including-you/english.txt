(Ray) You've always given me a ray of light
(Bright moonlight) I'll carry you
(Including) in my heart now
What is this feeling I feel as I wait for morning? (Hope)
Surely you'll give me the answer, as we gaze ahead (Ray)
With a thrill in the deep blue night sky (Change the world)
Passionate words are being repainted
If you say everything happens for a reason
Then I'll say that it was fate that brought us together
Because you gave me a dream
That I could devote 24 hours to, thank you for your life
The moonlight shines so brightly, always
Your sunny smile shines on me forevermore
No one can defeat this eternity
Ever since the day we met, you are my precious one
I wasn't afraid of being lost
Because the glowing footprints told me this was the "right way"
I couldn't have seen it if you weren't there
The dazzling sky spreading its wings at dawn
(I want to get closer) I've been thinking
There's something I want to protect (strength)
My heart prays for someone's smile that isn't mine (Ray)
I can't do it right away, but I want to (Wake me up)
The day I wished for it, it began to change
Nothing is (certain, it really isn't)
I have something I want to believe in
Don't let go of it (don't let go) and just keep running
You would (and I'm sure you would) say that, wouldn't you?
The moonlight shines so brightly, always
Your sunny smile shines on me forevermore
No one can defeat this eternity
Ever since the day we met, you are my precious one
I wasn't afraid of being lost
Because the glowing footprints told me this was the "right way"
I'll fly with you even more
The dazzling sky spreading its wings at dawn
