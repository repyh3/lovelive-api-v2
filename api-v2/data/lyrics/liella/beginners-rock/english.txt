Such a great weather! It's time to have breakfast
"Let's walk together" — maybe invite someone?
Can we finally get into that patisserie?
Though I'm not sure if we'll get those three patty
I'm not familiar with all this, but it's so shiny
What it is? My heart is beating so hard
Let's try to loosen up a little more,
That's what I'm thinking about at this time today
Let's rock even more vigorously, tearing the T-shirts on our chest
Isn't that what rock-and-roll is all about, right? Right? Even if it isn't!
Let's rock our hearts, it's not scary to make a mistake
If you want to do it, do it! Do it! You should do it
Let's go, Oh Ro Ro Ro Ro Ro Ro Rock!!
Why are there so many people in the city?
Maybe there will be a festival? Let's join the crowd
Where are we, after all...? It seems that we're completely lost
Well, okay, let's just see what's in the places that attracted us
I can't help but worry, I don't want to miss anything
It's okay to be overly optimistic, or misunderstand something
If you want to believe it, you can try to believe it
Even if it's different from what others have
Let's continue rock vigorously, getting rid of all common sense
Isn't that what rock-and-roll is all about, right? Right? Right, yeah!
Let's rock our hearts, it's not scary to make a mistake
If you want to do it, do it! Do it! You should do it
Let's go, Oh Ro Ro Ro Ro Ro Ro Rock!!
Puff out your chest, it's beginners rock!!
