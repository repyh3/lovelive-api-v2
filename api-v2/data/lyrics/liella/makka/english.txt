It's impossible to grow up, by complaining that you're lonely or sad
Letting time drip away in ambiguity is outrageous
("It's time to grow up!")
I know, I know — I won't be deceived, okay?
(Those formless things are lies!)
If I dared to believe in love or dreams
I'd only end up hurt, fading away in the end
Stop with your selfish talk, bye-bye, I've had enough!
Pain, pain, go away!
There are things that can't be cleanly divided, don't you see that? Understand me!
Is this clear, oh great world?
We struggle, we doubt, yet still
We notice, even the prettiest words
When peeled away, are all lies
Shattered into pieces, things break in an instant
My trust in people and my own confidence too
So, where will they strike next?
(Isn't irrationality a monster?)
Before I know it, it sneaks up on me, and look
Even my heart ends up completely bright red
In the end, even if I trust, I'll only be betrayed (betrayed)
(And yet,) why do I still want to believe?
I've had enough of this pain — no more!
Is there a right answer? Tell me, please
What is this suffering, this darkness — what does it mean?
I can't seem to grow up
Stop with your selfish talk, bye-bye, I've had enough!
Pain, pain, go away!
There are things that can’t be cleanly divided, don't you see that? Understand me!
Is this clear, oh unlucky fate?
We struggle, we doubt, yet still
We notice there's a light of hope that will never peel away
Please, keep shining beautifully
And don't become a blatant lie
