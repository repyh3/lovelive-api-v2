Let's make a promise
To always be as one
As we set off
Because it makes our hearts pump
Because we're chasing after it
There's no one particular reason
It's just because we love chasing after our dreams
That's what you've always been telling me
And that's how I found something in me that will never change
The radiance of someone out there will one day transform into courage
We'll continue believing in that as we set off
I'm sure that the reason we met, the reason you're by my side
Is so that we can laugh from the bottom of our hearts together
I won't ever leave you, we'll always be together, no matter what the future may bring
(Sing a song for all!)
Let's make a promise
To always be as one, Let's dream!
It’s hard to realize what's important
By yourself, isn't it?
But when you told me, I realized again,
"Oh, right, that's what it was."
I'm always the one receiving
At least let me repay you
So when you feel like crying,
I'll be by your side, close to your true feelings.
We're sharing our true voices
For that, we must be continuing to share the same dream.
I won't ever let go, we'll always be together, with our hands clasped together
The light that was sent out thousands of years ago
Shines on us, like those stars
Even if this moment ends,
The sparkle will never fade.
So, let's set off, now.
Meeting you taught me what it means
To truly seek someone from the heart,
And the meaning of the word "connected."
I'm sure that the reason we met, the reason you're by my side
Is so that we can laugh from the bottom of our hearts together
I won't ever leave you, we'll always be together, no matter what the future may bring
(Sing a song for all!)
Let's make a promise
To always be as one, Let's dream!
