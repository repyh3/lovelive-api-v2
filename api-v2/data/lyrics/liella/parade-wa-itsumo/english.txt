Like soap bubbles floating through the sky
New beginnings always catch us by surprise
Once you hear a cheerful rhythm playing in your ears
That's when you know the parade is here
The surprise on your face turns into a smile
As wonder grips my heart, I think to myself, oh, how brightly you shine!
The parade casts a spell on us
Making the whole wide world sparkle with light in but an instant
Just standing there spell-shocked is such a shame
So I'll jump right in together with you, and enjoy myself all the same!
Even if I'm not quite sure why, slowly but surely
It'll captivate me like it always does!
Bathing in the glow of the lights dancing with a swirl
Before I realize it, it's already well underway
You and I are two peas in a pod
May our emotions cascade here in this parade
As if trying to emulate our feelings
The fluffy clouds, they're floating free for all to see!
The parade casts a spell on us
Making even the smallest things look prettier than they ever were
Even though this feels like a dream, it most certainly is not
So I'll jump right on together with you, and enjoy myself all the same
Now that we're holding hands like this
This moment onwards will become more important
I'm glad you're feeling the same way too, ah!
Surely I'm about to discover something exciting that I never knew about
As wonder grips my heart, I think to myself, oh, you just nodded your head!
The parade casts a spell on us
Making the whole wide world sparkle with light in but an instant
Just standing there spell-shocked is such a shame
So I'll jump right in together with you, and enjoy myself all the same!
Even if I'm not quite sure why, slowly but surely
It'll captivate me like it always does!
