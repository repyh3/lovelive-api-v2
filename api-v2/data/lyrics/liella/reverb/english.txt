The nostalgic voice that echoes through the clear sky
The moment I wake up, it melts back into the sunshine
Though the seasons change without telling me anything
I'll still remember everything that hasn't changed
I find myself asking:
"Have I become a little stronger than I was before?"
In the midst of memories, eyes that sway...
The warmth of you still lingers in my heart
You give me a smile that transcends time
The countless letters I've hidden in my desk
Are slowly fading away, but the memories remain in my mind
You gave me kindness and courage.
I'll keep them safe and warm
From this moment onwards.
I still embrace your warmth in my heart
It feels like that you're always, always nearby
Even now, my memories of you shine brightly
You give me a smile that transcends time
