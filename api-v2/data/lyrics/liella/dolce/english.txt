Looking up at the large tree before me
Brings me on a trip back in time
To all the sights I saw when I was a kid
All my plushies sat in the audience
Watching the stage by the windowsill
As I sung
Under the sun streaming in
Can you hear them too?
All those comforting melodies
As I sing, I can't help but to remember those days
Ah, those songs truly were my best friends
As I sing, I see them once again in my mind's eye
Ah, how I loved them back then
Looking up at the large tree before me
I turn the key to the chest
Holding the memories from when we held each other's tiny hands
All the crayon drawings of
A colorful future we drew together
When we got tired,
We dozed off next to each other
Can you feel them too?
All those warm harmonies
As I laugh, I can't help but to remember those days
Ah, when only our smiles were shining bright
As I laugh, I see them once again in my mind's eye
Ah, how I loved them back then
They'll always be close by
Soon to be within reach if you want them
Our feelings basking in the light
We may forget those days again
Ah, but I'll remember them again and again
As I laugh, I see them once again in my mind's eye
Ah, how I'll always love them
Lala, lala, lalalalala
Lala, lala, lalalala
Lala, lala, lalalalala, now
