Everybody ready? ALRIGHT (WOOH)
HOT! HOT! Happy Day!
Welcome to WONDERLAND! (YEAH!)
HA! HA! Harmony
Everybody ready? ALRIGHT (WOOH)
Hearts race as we fly into the sky (OOOH)
We're ready to spread our wings and fly (Flying so high)
How far will we go underneath the burning hot sun? (Thinking)
It'll be great (With you) if we run together (It's so so good)
Hey, let's find something new that'll surpass our expectations
Quickly GO
Bursting with light, our sparkle goes ON, ON and ON (No stopping)
Don't be shy, be bold and free
Look over here and show me your smile
HOT PASSION!! Make some noise
Let's get excited and dyed tropically
A single-minded dream
Is bouncing around in the sky, like it alway does. C'mon, let's fly!
Yay yeah! This is our PASSION!!
We'll embrace this hot, strong feeling and carve this beat, love, and emotion into our hearts
La-la-la-la-la I want to make the best memories bloom
Forever
We're being pulled along by the sunshine; Let's go
It feels like we could high-five the sky today; Jump in?
Is your heart racing? Yes, yes!
Are you excited? Yes, yes!
And so this one time will in fact be a fun time
It's so nice to dance to your heart's content (totally)
It feels like a dream... (but) it's not a dream. (That's right)
We can't just sit around.
Let's do something!
Quickly GO
Bursting into flames, it feels like we're swaying and melting ON, ON and ON (Get ready)
I want it to be grand and exhilarating one day
Let's get crazy and have some fun!
HOT PASSION!! Make some noise
Let's get excited and dyed tropically
We're shining so bright
It's now or never. Ah, c'mon let's fly one more time!
Yay yeah! This is our PASSION!!
The moment we leave the ground, time will stop as we fly through the sky
La-la-la-la-la we'll share a little bit of eternity together
HOT PASSION!! Make some noise
Let's get excited and dyed tropically
A single-minded dream
Is bouncing around in the sky, like it alway does. C'mon, let's fly!
Yay yeah! This is our PASSION!!
We'll embrace this hot, strong feeling and carve this beat, love, and emotion into our hearts
La-la-la-la-la I want to make the best memories bloom
Forever
