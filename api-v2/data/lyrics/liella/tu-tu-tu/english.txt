When you blew away the clouds,
In that sky that was about to cry,
That's when I realized that it's more important
To give things a try rather than think too hard about it!
You've always been here,
Always laughing,
I want it to stay like this,
With you always by my side
Hey, promise me that
Together...
Tu tu tu tu; let's keep singing
Tu tu tu; these honest feelings.
They're amazing, just the way they are.
Tu tu tu tu; we could always change.
Tu tu tu!; we always knew that.
So let's talk to each other some more
Um...Shining melody
The scent of Spring, the blue sky in Summer,
An Autumn breeze, and my white breath in Winter
I've always been here,
Always laughing,
Can it stay like this,
With you always by my side?
Together...
Tu tu tu tu; let's keep singing
Tu tu tu; these honest feelings.
May this moment stay as it always has been
Tu tu tu tu; thank you for everything
Tu tu tu; Let's keep going
As the next season is upon us.
Um...Shining melody
Tururururuturu
