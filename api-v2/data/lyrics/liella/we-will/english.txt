We're now going to fight
Let's create our own wind
We're going to climb
We're never going to lose, we're going to win!
More, more, more!!
Let's always surpass
Who we were yesterday
Even if we don't know
Just how much we can do, we're always fired up
I want to smile together with you
I want to know about worlds I've yet to discover
I'm going to become stronger
I don't want to give up
Are you ready? Let's start up right now!
We're going to aim for the top
More than now, more than ever
Our hearts are pounding
Let's make it come true!
Right at this moment, as much as we can
We're dreaming, because that's all we can do
We met, so this wish gives us passion
We can go
Let's make the impossible happen
We're going to continue believing, so WE WILL!!
I want to go beyond "fun"
I want to keep going until the very end
When we've come full circle in the future,
Everything will seem more fun
Keep the momentum going, and jump up high!
Let's give it a try
From now on, from here out
We're setting off on an adventure!
We're going to win!
When our excitement peaks, then
We can make it to the very top
There's nothing we can't do when we're with you
We'll keep going
Thank you for all the tears you've brought me
If we look forward, then WE WILL!!
We're now going to fight
Losing is not an option
Let's get it started now
Head towards a new horizon, here we go!
Chasing after that superstar
Surpassing our limits
More than now, more than ever
We're going to shine
Let's make it come true!
Right at this moment, as much as we can
We're dreaming, because that's all we can do
We met, so this wish gives us passion
We can go
Let's make the impossible happen
We're going to continue believing, so WE WILL!!
Get ready, WE WILL!!
