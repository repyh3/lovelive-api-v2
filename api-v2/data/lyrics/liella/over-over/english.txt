Start running forward! Dreamer
"Good morning" is what I call out to the cat by the street corner
That is the signal for the curtain to rise
The music through my headphones flips the switch
And the next season starts to pour in
Tick-tock-tick-tock, time keeps moving forward
Let's shine brightly without any compromise
Don't ever let go of your dreaming heart
The hope that you hold out is endless
Come true! Come true! With the blue sky pushing me on,
I take another step forward
How far will we be able to go?
You won't know until you start running
That's just fine (and that's why it's fine)
Charge in with all your might and surpass the speed of light, dreamer
With sweat running down my cheeks and the wind rushing by
I take a breather on a staircase I've never seen before
In times like these, my heart is the only compass I trust
So, which direction is this pounding heart pulling me towards?
I'm crying beause I'm getting serious
At last, we finally reached that towering wall
Face that determination to see it through head-on
Everytime you believed, a new path had appeared
Even if I stumble (even I am like this)
C'mon, now is the time to
Prove that we can fly together
The things that I want to do right now, the things that I can only do right now
Some things can't be (not that easily) measured or weighed (and we're out of time)
Now, take them down coming from the right! (Let's go!)
This dreaming heart won't ever stop
The hope that you hold out won't ever stop
Come true! Come true! With the blue sky pushing me on,
I take another step forward
How far will we be able to go?
You won't ever know unless you keep running
That's just fine (and that's why it's fine)
Dive on in, dreaming at the speed of light, chasing after it
Rising above the people who we are today
