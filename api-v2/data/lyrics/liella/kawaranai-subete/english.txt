You're always smiling beside me
"See you later." The moment I wave my hand,
I hear the sound of shoes
Ah, I always thought this was normal
The gentle breeze, and the sunlight we chased after
All of it is important
There is always something irreplaceable
Inside of your heart (See the light)
You won't see it if you stare into the distance
I hope everyday will continue
To be the same as usual
I want to convey it from the bottom of my heart
Thank you, thank you
Everything remains the same
The swings in the park sway back and forth
The sound of innocent laughter fills the air
As we play with the falling raindrops
Surely you can find this sort of scenery anywhere, but even so,
It's important. Even as time goes by,
Please don't ever fade away.
"See you later."
I'll see you back here, okay?
I thought it was normal
Everything, everything is a treasure
You won't see it if you stare into the distance
I hope everyday will continue
To be the same as usual
I want to convey it from the bottom of my heart
Thank you, thank you
Everything remains the same
Let's convey it
