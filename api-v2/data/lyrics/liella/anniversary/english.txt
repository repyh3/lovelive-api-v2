I wonder how much time has passed
Since I first met you
Giving voice to those memories floating in my head
Make even the flowers smile
Although I can't seem to find
The right thing to say
This definitely isn't goodbye, it's a new beginning
It's an anniversary I hold dear
I'll continue believing in myself
Who worked so hard to get here
I'll wave far into the distance
Taking shelter from the rain under a tree
With your shoulder against mine
You hesitantly whisper into my ear
That wish you hold so dear
Its sparkle continues pushing me forward
Even till this day
I too shall set forth on a journey chasing after my dreams
On this quiet anniversary
Until the day we meet again somewhere far away
I'll keep walking down this path
We'll make this hope blossom
By eventually turning it into tiny seedlings
So, we can aim for this new place
This definitely isn't goodbye, it's a new beginning
It's an anniversary I hold dear
I'll continue believing in myself
Who worked so hard to get here
Heading off into the distance
