How many times have we seen each other,
Said goodbye and crossed paths?
We have always been struggling
To climb the stairs to adulthood
You told me it was inevitable
And I bit my lip hard
That day, I could go far with you
I thank you for always looking ahead
Losing ourselves and finding ourselves again,
We have come this far together, right?
(Starry Prayer)
I've already made up my mind, no matter what tomorrow brings
I will never give up being by your side
Holding hands
How long can I feel this warmth?
"I've said nonsense things again"
I don't want you to get mad about it
The wind blows and I get confused
I don't even know if I can resist
If we go further up these stairs,
Would our wishes come true?
You're so innocent, you don't give up on anything
I know because I've seen you up close
(Starry Heavens)
Don't smile anymore with that lonely face
I will erase everything unpleasant that is in your future
I'll turn the pages to the sound of the flashes
You gave me this joy
That I was always waiting for
Losing ourselves and finding ourselves again
I'll keep walking by your side
I already decided, no matter what happens tomorrow,
I won't let go of your hand until the end
Sometimes I can't help it,
I still can't change my feelings
(Starry Prayer)
I already decided, I'll tell you before tomorrow comes
I want to always be by your side, I won't give up
