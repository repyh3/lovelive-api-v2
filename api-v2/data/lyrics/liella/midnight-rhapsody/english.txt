My heart beat races as I'm almost ready to meet you
Your fingertips unconsciously dance to the beat of the heartbeat
The second hand keeps glaring at me, hurry up! Come on! Turn!
Let me insert the key into the 22 o'clock door
Why can't I help it that I'm so caught up in this moment?
I can't go back to the clever girl I was in the past
The tuning is getting more and more out of tune
And yet it's so comfortable, such a wondrous rendezvous
Show me, show me, show me more
I want to drink in the free night
On this night of freedom,
Shall we go to a dangerous dream?
I want to show you how fun this midnight ball with me
When I am with you; Crazy and fun midnight
Never-ending show time, your never-changing expression
Before I knew it, my heart is sweetly rolling
Moonlight is fading, but the night goes on
I'm going to forever follow you to a world of paradise
A colorful world that seems to reach the city that has already fallen asleep
I'm so dazzled by the dazzling lights; I squint my eyes and I can't look away
The floor is getting hotter and hotter
The orange stands twinkle like mirror balls
Which of us is it, you or me?
Who's the one who is captivated?
The answer is probably mutual
We're always suddenly moving away from each other
Without even saying goodbye
All night long, we held each other
If we had never met
I wouldn't have known the sadness
That I wish we'd never meet again
I'm not so naive as to regret it
I'm actually a little bit evil
Well, let's call it a miracle
We were drawn to each other
And were drinking in the night of freedom
It's just a fleeting dream, please don't wake up
Stay with me, never walk away
My heart throbs during this midnight
Whisper to me the moment you disappear; See you!
