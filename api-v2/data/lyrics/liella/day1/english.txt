From the gap between the clouds shines a ray of sunshine
With a light step, I jump over the puddles
Something about the street looks different today
I've got a feeling that this is the start of something new
In my heart,
I've got the answer that I've kept locked away, but I'll release it today
A big dream that spreads from here across the world
Let's go around that corner and make it come true, hand in hand
I've found the recipe for changing this ordinary scenery
As long as you're with me
I feel like everything is going to be fine
Let's carry on to that place we've dreamed of
It's never too late
Nothing is impossible
No matter when you set your mind on it, that day will be the start of your Day1
This unfamiliar scenery
We're at the start line where it all starts changing
An everlasting story to call our own
Let's start it together now
Some music that livens up our endless routine
It's a signal that only we understand, bringing us together in tune
Each and every one of us is unique, you can't be replaced
Stuck in the same old place, I want to change that now
I want some more excitement
I want my heart to beat faster
Let's take those boring days and put a new coat of paint on them
Nothing is too high for us
I'm not going to hold back anymore
Let's summon our courage, and with our legs we'll jump right into wherever we go
How tight you hold my hand sends a message
You are not alone
Let's start a new story with everyone
We'll hold hands tightly
And overcome any tall wall
There's a scenery that you can't see alone
But if we're all together, we can see it
The sound of our racing hearts signals the start
It's never too late
Nothing is impossible
No matter when you set your mind on it, that day will be the start of your Day1
This unfamiliar scenery
We're at the start line where it all starts changing
An everlasting story to call our own
Let's start it together now
