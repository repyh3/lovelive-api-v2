I wonder how many things
Wouldn't exist without me?
I want to believe that there are so many of them
That the fingers of both hands are not enough
Why are you holding your breath, dissolving into the atmosphere?
Why are you trembling all the time, pretending that you don't exist?
No matter how hard you hide, I can still find you
So scream with your heart
When the rain mixed with the sun,
A seven-colored rainbow spread over us
And we held our breath just like this
Without even thinking to dry our soaking wet hair
I will grab a little hope
I will open the door to tomorrow
Let's unceasingly connect
Alternate, of which there is no end, so that they shine
If we end up getting out of the flow of people,
(Together with you, ah)
Instead of slowing down, I want to run
At a fast tempo
You gave me these free emotions
Dreaming is a jewel, I quietly got it
Your smile that filled the moments of silence,
I can still see it clearly
Drops that have fallen on the asphalt,
Their outlines are slowly melting
I'm sure that like this in the end,
We'll definitely find a place where the light is
Don't erase your passion
Don't hold back your impatient heartbeat
Let's in the course of their birth connect
Alternate, taking turns spreading them everywhere
If I were alone, I would (already) break off
So let's run forward, biting our lips,
Together with you
When the rain mixed with the sun,
A seven-colored rainbow spread over us
Let's hold our breath just like this
Laughing at each other's soaking wet hair
I will grab a little hope
I will open the door to tomorrow
Let's unceasingly connect
Alternate, of which there is no end, so that they shine
