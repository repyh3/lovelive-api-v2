How does a person become someone
Who's lovely and gorgeous?
If you can hear my heart racing,
Let me know, but don't tell anyone else
Saying "I can't do it" is Non! Non! Non!
"But I can do it if I tried," I say
To myself while looking in the mirror
C'mon! Let's cast a magic spell
No matter what is happening,
You'll always find girls on the runway
Striking all sorts of brilliant poses
And throwing cute winks your way
Everyone can become a sparkling heroine
From the time they are born to now, just look around you
You can be the most wonderful thing in the galaxy too
Let's hold onto that thought even more
Only one star is reflected in your eyes,
And she's letting her hair fly in the wind
Yes, the maiden who dares to dream
Is so frightenedly beautiful
When you smile, any place you set foot in
Turns into a runway
Pull off a graceful spin
Because all eyes are on you!
Everyone can be a special heroine
Who bathes in the dazzling lights
You're the only person in the galaxy
Shower me with your praises some more
I've been chasing after
My Cinderella story
But I want to climb those
Stairs to happiness myself! So, now...
Sparkle! We're all heroines
From the moment we were born to now!
You can be the most wonderful thing in the galaxy too
Let's hold onto that thought even more
I'll hold onto that thought even more, 'kay☆
