Yes! We'll make our sound resound
To the end of the universe; we'll deliver our happiness
Even when we're stumbling through life, about to cry,
Let's praise our persistent selves
It's okay if we lose, because someday that frustration
Will turn into the strength to move forward
So, let's go! Let's dance! (We're getting better, bit by bit!)
We'll form a circle; let's forget everything unpleasant and smile
Yes! We'll make our footsteps ring out
To the end of the universe! (Let it ring out!) Clap your hands! (Clap!)
We're feeling great! And our mood is only going up from here
Yes! We'll sing, wow wow wow wow
And our sound will reach further,
That's what the future will be like, happiness!
Isn't it okay if we pour out
Our true feelings?
If we have courage, then the day that we understand each other will come
Let's believe in that, and take on this challenge!
Together, let's jump! (Jump continuously!)
On one, two, three, we'll go and become stars!
Yes! We've become connected through this magical pull
Let your heart ring out! (Ring out!) La la celebrate! (Celebrate!)
We'll cross the Milky Way!
Yes! Tomorrow wow wow wow wow
We'll be even louder than today
We'll always be this happy!
Yes! We'll dash forward at the speed of light
With your sound and my sound, we'll go faster! Faster!
Yes! We'll make our footsteps ring out
To the end of the universe! (Let it ring out!) Clap your hands! (Clap!)
We're feeling great! We'll plunge ahead
Get ready, set! If we make our sound heard, it won't ever end
Yes, this is our happiness!
