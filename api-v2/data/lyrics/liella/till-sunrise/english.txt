Go with the flow,
Let's dance all night,
Till sunrise.
Illuminated by the pale, moonlit night
(You and I, you and I, with little fear inside our hearts)
You're on the beach, gazing far off into the distance.
Before the tomorrow which we still can't see comes,
(Let it be, let it be, let it be, it's ok)
I'll entrust my body to the rhythm of the neverending waves.
We're barefoot, kicking at the sand like children.
Let's dance! Let's sing! Let it all out.
Hugging our hopes closer to our chest,
We'll dance all night.
Oh my! Under the stage light of the starry sky,
This passion will never waver.
We'll gather this brilliance, as we feel it,
Let's laugh together until the end of time.
La la la la la la all right,
La la la la la la so nice.
We'll play around with this two step,
Let's dance the night away,
You and me, till sunrise.
We'll make the best, happiest time ever now, (hey! hey!)
With this unpolished choreography lol (hey! hey!)
What are you gonna do? Those moves are kinda sick!
C'mon, put your hands up, don't stop me
We're gonna go all night.
These lines have been said millions of times, but
Being with you brings me happiness,
I feel like anything and everything will go well when I'm with you.
We're barefoot, kicking at the sand like children.
Let's dance! Let's sing! Let it all out.
We'll snuggle up close and dream,
Together.
Move right! That's it, that's exactly the feeling.
Now we go left, and they start to overlap.
Look, when the two of us shine,
The moonlight becomes brighter.
La la la la la la all right,
La la la la la la so nice.
Jump and leap, jumping,
Let's dance the night away,
You and me, till sunrise.
Rays of light shine onto the distant horizon,
Please don't let it end, I don't want to stop,
You and me, till sunrise.
Oh my! Under the stage light of the starry sky,
This passion will never waver.
We'll gather this brilliance, as we feel it,
Let's laugh together until the end of time.
La la la la la la all right,
La la la la la la so nice,
We'll play around with this two step,
Let's dance the night away,
You and me, till sunrise.
