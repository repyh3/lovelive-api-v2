Even if there's something I can't do on my own right now
I can do my best knowing it's for everyone
I want to connect with your shining smile
If this feeling of fun spreads,
We can fly anywhere, even into space
This love, this happiness
I'll tell you all about them, and I won't waver anymore
Let's step onto the next stage with a smile
