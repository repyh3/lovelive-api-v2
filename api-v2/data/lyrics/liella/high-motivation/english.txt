Hey! Everybody
Get ready! Go! Fight!
The highest level of motivation
I look up to them, but, even so, I want to stay my one and only self
My contradictions and my selfishness, I hope you'll see them as signs of growth
Jumping around on the rooftop - warming up!
So, shall we get started? (Let's raise the level)
Even though we're far apart, your message resonated with me
High!
I've decided to sing straight and true to myself
The next time we meet, I want you to say, "has something changed?"
High!
Let's show off our individuality and charm, no more being shy!
Because what we want is to shine!
Keep moving (keep moving) we're gonna do our best, so keep watching us
Hey! Everybody
Get ready! Go! Fight!
The highest level of motivation
The secret to getting better is hard work, so I'll give it another try!
Believe in yourself, you can do 10 times more than you can imagine
Write down all your goals - tension up!
There are a lot of tasks (the more the merrier)
I want to show the contrast between my usual self and my character; both are the best
High!
"Because we love it" that's all we need. Let's join hands and form a circle
It's because we can share the same dream. Let's struggle, and laugh together
High!
It feels like we could even become a flower bouquet, just kidding☆
Because we're just this colorful!
It blooms (it blooms) in a color unlike any other
It's not just for a chosen few
Everyone has the power to shine
Let's take a bold step forward
Ready, set! (Ready, set!) Let's fly! (We're flying!)
I touched my dream! (Let's go even further!)
High!
We've decided to sing straight and true with all our hearts
The next time we meet, I want you to say, "has something changed?"
High!
We've got so much individuality and charm, we're not shy about it!
Because we want to stand tall and shine
Keep moving (keep moving) we're gonna do our best, so keep watching us
Hey Everybody
Get ready! Go! Fight!
