Why am I so excited
On this early Sunday morning?
Singing while jumping over puddles on the street,
Brings back feelings of innocence and childhood.
I've finally found what I want to become,
The thrill from that time (the shine from that day) is still here, even now!
(Joy stretches out endlessly, hope is before my eyes!)
It's a sky-blue Sunday, Sunday.
Why, why is it that we're always
Dreaming about our dreams and nothing else?
It's a wonderful Sunday, Sunday.
Nothing will disappear, nothing at all.
This admiration's more beautiful
Than a precious gem.
The streets are still asleep, peaceful,
A stray cat strolls down the street.
In just a bit, it's gonna be
Full of people, bustling about.
There's all types of scenery
And ways the wind blows by (blowing by, fluffily); and there's a bunch of sides to us as well!
(Every day, every month, everything's constantly changing, and we keep discovering new things!)
But even so it's Sunday, Sunday.
Why, why are you just wishing?
We're always laughing this way, aren't we?
I love this Sunday, Sunday.
Don't just stay still, don't!
Let's walk on this sun-bathed street,
As far as we can go!
Skip about until you start breathing a bit hard,
Look, your heart, it's dancing about gracefully!
(Joy stretches out endlessly.)
It's a sky-blue Sunday, Sunday.
Why, why is it that we're always
Dreaming about our dreams and nothing else?
It's a wonderful Sunday, Sunday.
Nothing will disappear, nothing at all.
This admiration,
Lighting up our hearts,
(It's almost blinding)
Is more beautiful than a precious gem!
