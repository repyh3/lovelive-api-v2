I was so excited that I forgot about my nerves
The moment I met you
I felt like I could do something
And I wanted to do it
Un deux, deux!
Deux, deux..!
It's frustrating stumbling in the same places
But it's still kinda fun
I can't wait to do the steps perfectly
C'mon, soon we'll be doing the un deux trois!
It's shining, it feels like I'm dreaming
Let's dance the night away day by day
Everytime I take a step, a flower will bloom
Dance, dance in this world!
Sometimes, it's painful loving this too much
But when we leave, we miss it
We've found something we enjoy doing
We are the happiest people
Un deux, deux!
Deux, deux..!
An endless cycle of moving then stopping
But that's okay, I'm doing my best
It's a race to see who can nail it first
C'mon, let's go; un deux trois!
We'll spin around together, stand a little straighter if you want
Powering up with every step we take
Let's laugh away these difficult moments
Dance, dance on the day we met!
There's no reason at all, it's always
Been hidden inside of me, this heat
We're like you, that's right
We're gonna tell me in a non-serious way
The world I jumped into by holding your hand
I want to make it more beautiful
Surely when it's with you, surely when it's with us
Trust us now and dance, dance!
It's shining, it feels like I'm dreaming
Let's dance the night away day by day
Everytime I take a step, let's make the flowers bloom
Blooming dance, dance with us!
