Let us sing, la la la la, may our voices cascade
We won't leave anyone behind as we set off
We'll dive headfirst into the very same dream as we set off
A warm breeze brings with it boundless hope
Inviting us to quickly join it high up in the sky
Even the many dangers ahead of us will not be enough to stop us
Rolling down (rolling down), a huge rock (coming straight) towards us
Become one (with the wind) breathe in (and breathe out) and sidestep it
All the things that we can't do when alone, I'm sure we'll be able to do it if we're together
We'll make sure our hearts are bound as one as we set off on yet another adventure!
Lu Lu La; even if all we encounter are things we never thought possible
Lu Lu La; we'll chase after the light, no matter how far we have to go!
The stars are, la la la la, singing loudly
Just tell me how you really feel
I know it's scary, but I'm here to support you
Shaking violently (shaking violently), the suspension bridge (sways) as we walk across
We made it (to the other side) with our hearts (and bodies) in one piece
Riding a small mine cart, hoping to send each other a signal
We may butt heads at times, but we're still good friends
Hey, if we were to wave up at the night sky, a new sun will rise
Three! (What kind of) Two! (Day) One! (Awaits us?)
Let's get going!
Now matter how steep the road is, we'll whistle our way through it
I'm sure we'll overcome this hurdle by believing in our bond
All the things that we can't do when alone, I'm sure we'll be able to do it if we're together
We'll make sure our hearts are bound as one as we set off on yet another adventure!
We're setting off on an adventure, always
Lu Lu La; even if all we encounter are things we never thought possible
Lu Lu La; we'll chase after the light, no matter how far we have to go!
