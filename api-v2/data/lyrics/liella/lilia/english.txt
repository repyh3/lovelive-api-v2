Feelings that can't be explained with words
The subtle changes in color
After going over it again and again,
And worrying maybe I'm starting to understand
Oh, always close right here in my heart is you and me
Even though I was satisfied (all this time, this time)
My heart keeps filling up with
More and more memories I could never replace
It's okay if you never change
Because even the wind gently smiles and tells you that
"You're beautiful just the way you are"
Wake up, brilliance
I'm trying to believe in myself, so, don't let me down
A flower begins to bloom
LiLiA
This voice echoes far into the distance, and it makes me so happy
I sing LiLiA
New world, world is so brilliant
It's like the sunrise
This is the moment things began to change
New world, world is so brilliant
I stand in the light
LiLiA
I drifted through a formless montage
Repeating it without much of a reason
I secretly hope to see
What kind of version of myself I will become
Even if my confidence is fragile
Like it could vanish with the wind, it's still enough
I'll shield it with both hands and always protect it
Shine with brilliance
Even if I can't do anything, I don't want to cry
So I look up
LiLiA
I've moved past those dark nights, and I'll never stop for them again
I feel LiLiA
Even if I don't know where this world is headed
LiLiA
My strained voice will still reach you, aiming straight ahead
I sing LiLiA
I'm trying to believe in myself, so, don't let me down
A flower begins to bloom
LiLiA
This voice, echoing forward, shining in a pure white light
Stay with LiLiA
New world, world is so brilliant
It's like the sunrise
This moment never stops changing
New world, world is so brilliant
I stand in the light
LiLiA
