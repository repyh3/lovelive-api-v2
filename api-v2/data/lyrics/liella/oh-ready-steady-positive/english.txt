My heart throbs, happiness fills the air
Pastel pochette, check!
I'll go with my colorful hoodie today
Guess I'll buy a chocolate banana flavored crepe
I have no other choice! Don't get tempted by anything else!
It's okay if things don't go the way I planned
I'll just keep moving forward with a positive mindset
My policy is "like what you want to like!"
(I will occasionally) feel a bit down
(But if I just eat) something delicious, everything will be all right!
I'll believe it when I feel it
Hey, my heart is free, and it always will be
I'll make my dreams come true, even if they seem impossible
Cause you'll never know if you don't try!
So c'mon! Today we're going to be
Oh! Ready steady positive
My heart throbs, happiness fills the air
I've always longed for some cute lipstick
But got distracted along the way
I won't feel down! I'll keep walking
And enjoy the things happening around me
Even if I have so many things I need to do,
I still visit all of the places I'm interested in
Sometimes, I can't help it if it's all I think about
(Parfaits, cookies) and a candy shop too
(I still want to go) so I'm sure it'll be fine!
I want to be happy, so I want to take what I can get
That's why I think it's okay to be a little bit selfish
Let's give it a try, even if we don't know if we can
When you start to feel anxious,
Just say the magic words:
Oh! Ready steady positive
(I'll recharge myself) by drinking some milk tea
(So, are you ready?) I'm ready to start!
I'll believe it when I feel it
Hey, my heart is free, and it always will be
I'll make my dreams come true, even if they seem impossible
Cause you'll never know if you don't try!
So c'mon! Today we're going to be
Oh! Ready steady positive
My heart throbs, happiness fills the air
