Take a deep breath, and release that passion
May we always meet people different to us
Let's take it all in: we won't have "moments" like this again
Rather than say it's impossible, let's enjoy ourselves instead
The air dances around us when our shoulders sway
This feeling (Let's do it now!!)
Is rising (Up to you!!)
Shining... (even our sweat)
...so bright (moves in slow motion)
Our hearts burn fiercely
I wish it would never end, if only time would stop
I want to see this view spreading before me now for a little bit longer
You've noticed, haven't you?
See, our hearts are beating in unison!
I'll never forget the melodies we've sung together
Our hearts will always be the same
This fever refuses to leave again and again
Stumbling through the sadness,
I invite you to join us to walk past tomorrow
These moments of happiness make us stronger
This disconnected rhythm
Also becomes something that's important "now"
You don't need to worry about anything else
It's okay if you're clumsy! Just take that first step with confidence
I can't say it, I'm throwing away my happiness
Wave your hands (Change my mind!!)
As much as you can (I wanna do!!)
We'll convey (to you)
How we really feel (how we feel)
I want to feel the moment we connect
Hey, give us some more!
We'll always be here (I wish)
The hands on the clock won't change (to move on)
We'll still hold onto these moments with you
I wish it would never end, I want to tell you our dreams
Let's take this feeling spreading before us into the future
You've noticed, haven't you?
See, our hearts are beating in unison!
I'll never forget the melodies we've sung together
La! La! La! La! Lalalala!
La! La! La! La! Lalalala!
La! La! La! La! Lalala
I'll always remember the melody that plays forever
