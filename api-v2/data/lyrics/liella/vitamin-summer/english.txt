We used some acrobatics to blast through and crossed the blue sea; high five
Anything can come true in this vivid season
Our mischievous mode is turned on, so no need to hold back
Summer instantly makes us happy; it's an awesome showtime; now, let's dance
Clap your hands☆
Let's get hyped! And have plenty of fun
Not giving our all is just lame, lame, lame!
Say, yay, yay, yay, yay! Funky coconuts
We are juicy; we're the children of summer
Let's get into the groove, heaven, heaven, heaven
Oh, bay-bay-baby! Crazy coconuts
Let's add some color to these white hearts, Vitamin SUMMER!
Give us that excitement, heaven, heaven, heaven
Yay, yay, yay! Bay-baby!
Yay, yay, yay! Bay-baby!
Fireworks explode in the sky at dusk
We make a promise while doing a poor attempt at a wink
We'll keep smiling even if we're exhausted!
The bond that connects us in summer will never come undone
Love and peace☆
Shout out loud! We're all shaking our bodies
Throw it up into the sky, peace, peace peace!
Say, yay, yay, yay, yay! Dancing coconuts
We're rookies; we're the children of dreams
Hey let's jump some more, heaven, heaven, heaven
Oh, bay-bay-baby! Dreaming coconuts
Let's add some color to the white future, Vitamin SUMMER!
It's so exciting, heaven, heaven, heaven
It's a shining summer, so let's try it (here's our chance, let's try it!)
It's a sound that won't stop (a sound that won't ever stop)
Say, yay, yay, yay, yay! Funky coconuts
We are juicy; we're the children of summer
Let's get into the groove, heaven, heaven, heaven
Oh, bay-bay-baby! Crazy coconuts
Let's add some color to these white hearts, Vitamin SUMMER!
Give us that excitement, heaven, heaven, heaven
Yay, yay, yay! Bay-baby!
Yay, yay, yay! Bay-baby!
