The joy of meeting you, the joy in our laughters
The time when we talked about our dreams
No matter how many times I fall, I’m sure I can do it
Sure, you were the one who gave me the strength to believe that
Now, let’s go; I’m not afraid anymore
I will reach out for your hand
The clouds are cleared up, and now the night sky is gleaming
Our hearts are shining bright, with a gentle twinkle
And always, you gave me a lot of the courage I needed
If you are by my side, I will be able to shine
This sparkle, I'm sure, someday, it will enlighten me too!
During the stormy nights, you were by my side
Floating in the firmament, there is our light
Illuminating our hearts connected as one
Our hopes are so much brighter than this star
Throwing a light towards this still unknown tomorrow
