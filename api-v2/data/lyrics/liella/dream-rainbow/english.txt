Why did my heart burst and fly away?
I'll never know unless I run to the answer
I'm still cowering, jumping over my fears
I shall hold your hands and become the wind
The white clouds are like polka dots
I looked up and laughed at them (looked up and laughed)
My heart was pounding (suddenly pounding)
I can't hear the sound of the beginning
(Now's the time! Let's go out)
I'm drawing arcs in the sky with my fingertips
The dream rainbow will come to life
Seeing it with my eyes isn't enough anymore
So, let's continue shining until the end of time
(I met you)
I feel it every time I harmonize with you
My excitement will last forever
I can go because you're with me
For example, yes, there's a rainbow in the night sky
Suddenly, I miss you. I wonder why?
I won't know until I open the door
Various feelings are born in a fluffy way
Like soap bubbles, the smell of my childhood
Swallow what you want to say
I couldn't say it well (you changed it)
Now, I can say it (everyone can say it)
I can be stronger (even stronger)
The sound of the beginning is echoing in my chest
I'm not alone, let's paint it
The dream rainbow I've been holding on to
Seeing it with my eyes isn't enough anymore
So, let's continue shining until the end of time
(I met you)
I feel it every time I harmonize with you
The excitement we believe awaits us in the future
I can go because you're with me
Rainbows are spreading across the sky
La, la, la, la, la, la!
