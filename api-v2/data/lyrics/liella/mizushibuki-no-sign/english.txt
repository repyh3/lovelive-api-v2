Roll up your sleeves, and start tanning
Take off your T-shirt and let's go
It's summer! Running on the hot sand
Every time we laugh together, it's so much fun!
It's not about making memories,
I just want to be with you
Jump right in and make a big splash
In the endless, spacious, clear sea
There's so many things about you that I have yet to know, right?
This chance won't come again, so
I'll swim through this season in search of excitement
Let's paint more light!
The day I waited impatiently for, ah...it's almost over
Let's promise to meet up again soon!
The sky is filled with everyone's voices
Scattered around like rays of light
Melting ice and bright red tongues;
They're treasures that can only be seen in this moment
I don't want to miss this!
Changing shapes while making a big splash
It's a never-ending, eternal, clear Summer
I'll treasure this very moment with you
Before we know it, the sun starts to set
And its rays shine all over the shore
We have to play even more!
The sunset blends into the waves
I'm starting to feel lonely, so I whisper
"Hey, we'll always be together, right?"
You were the first one to laugh,
And then we all started to laugh together
Making a big splash, spreading our wings in the sunlight
This chance won't come again, so
I'll swim through this season in search of excitement
Let's paint more light!
We'll all make a splash in the sea
