Please enjoy this wonderful moment
With my heartbeat racing, I'll bring you a thrill
Well then, if you're all ready,
Come on and try clapping your hands
Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap
With a single smile, that stirs the eyes
Already about to swim in a pool of tears
Fake or not, it doesn't matter because
You've already long since been lost in this labyrinth
You're in the palm of my hand, dancing just for me
You wear that poker face like it's second nature
Are you grinning? Thinking about your chances of winning?
Alright, here I go:
3・2・1... bomb!
We're already tangled up, so why not have some fun?
I'm at an age where I kind of want to lose
Well, it's pointless, since I have a card in my hand
That can turn into anything
Changing the game!!
Changing the game!!
Changing the game!!
Your thoughts are all tangled up... and honestly, it's way too cute
Mind games, come on, show me how to
Walk the tightrope, my eyes are on you
You didn't cover your risks at all, and there you go again,
Fumbling the endgame
We swapped our lines,
And now emotions shuffle like a deck of hearts
I've already read the cards in your hand
Don't get too comfortable, that's a bad move
I've got more than one wild card in my hand
This is so much fun! Look me in the eye
Deceiving and being deceived, even forgetting the time, just keep your eyes on me
Right there in the palm of my hand, I want you to step out of line
Let me see your poker face fall
I'll give you everything
...Just kidding, bomb!
We're already tangled up, so why not have some fun?
I'm at an age where I kind of want to lose
Well, it's pointless, since I am a card
That can turn into anything
Changing your fate!!
Changing your fate!!
Changing your fate!!
Your thoughts are all tangled up... and honestly, I love you too much
