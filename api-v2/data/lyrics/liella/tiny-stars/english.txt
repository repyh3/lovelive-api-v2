A shooting star races through
We chase after it and become stars
Sparkle!
(Tiny Stars)
In this night sky where nothing can be seen, we see a shooting star shoot across
Its shined so brilliantly that it gave us courage
Maybe one day we can be like that too
Hope has brought us the scent of a new season
Hello (Hello) My Dream
Let's start something new (even if it's scary)
Let's do it (we'll be fine) just like (always)
Our bond is right here
A shooting star races through
We chase after it and become stars
We won't stop, we can't stop, even if we're still small
Because we're not alone
We can continue forward without giving up
The tiny stars shine as many times as we've gotten back up
Sparkle!
A few simple words can become powerful before you even know it
That's why we throw all sorts of ideas at each other, regardless if they're joyful ones or not
I know (I know) the stars
They're reflected in the eyes (that knew the light)
We're out (of breath), trying to grab (our future)
Our miraculous story starts now
Wishing upon a shooting star
Twinkling in the distant sky
We can't reach it, we want to reach it, so we gotta go faster
The headwind is blowing again
Even if our thoughts will be blown away,
Let's whisper to each other to protect the feelings that have gently sprouted
I believe (but that's not enough) to make anything come true
Until it comes true (we'll have to keep running) through the darkness
This shining shooting star
We chase after it and become stars
We won't stop, we can't stop, even if we're still small
Because we want to continue dreaming
The same dream together forever
Let's hold our hands together tightly and go, tiny stars
Sparkle!
Sparkle!
