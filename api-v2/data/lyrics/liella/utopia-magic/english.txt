It might not make much sense, but it's fun
I wave up at the vapor trails
Laying down the checkered blanket;
Singing with you on the roof-top feels like utopia
(Fu-u) ah (ah), a breeze blows through the fence
(Fu-u) If I were to (grab it now), I feel like I could fly into the sky
I'll cast a spell on the same-old scenery
Your smile makes me happy
If you told me how you felt about me,
Anywhere could become the most wonderful place
From this moment onwards, I'll stay by your side
I promise!
No matter how many times I take a picture, it's always blurry
Let's try holding our breath, maybe that'll work? Ready...
(Fu-u) Saying something (or other) as we speak to each other softly
(Fu-u) hey (now) it feels like I'm on vacation, basking in the sunlight
The number of precious treasures are increasing
With you here, the future shines so bright
I forget about the time
This is the most wonderful place
Let me stop your fingers forever and ever
The world will keep changing
Sometimes, even the sun will hide itself
But if we're together when tomorrow comes,
Everywhere we go will be a paradise
I'll cast a spell on the same-old scenery
Just the way you smile makes me happy
Let's convey our feels for each other
Let's make this the most wonderful place
From this moment onwards, I'll stay by your side
I promise!
