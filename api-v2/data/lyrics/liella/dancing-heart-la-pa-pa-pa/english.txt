From a door that suddenly popped into view
I hear a voice? Someone's calling me!
Okay, let's venture out
Into a new world, La-Pa-Pa!
I grew wings and floated up into the sky
And from there I knew that anything was possible
Fly away, fly away, but to where do we fly?
Our wings will guide us, La-Pa-Pa
Dancing Heart, the excitement never ends!
Dancing Heart, when we're together!
Dancing Heart, hey, let's get started!
Sometimes it's fine to just go all out
I wanna try to make my dreams come true!
All these dreams I have, I feel like my heart's gonna burst
I wanna try to make my dreams come true!
Should we try it? Let's give it a try!
All together now, La-Pa-Pa-Pa!
All these feelings that have suddenly piled up
Shout 'em out! Tell someone about them!
Ah, in that moment I got an answer
Let me hear you say La-Pa-Pa!
Dancing Heart, since we wanted to shine,
Dancing Heart, us, together,
Dancing Heart, we met each other!
Sometimes weird coincidences like that are fine too
I wanna reach you! I will reach you!
Just wait, there's even more amazing things to come!
I wanna reach you! I will reach you!
What we feel right now as we're feeling it
Let's put it into song, La-Pa-Pa-Pa!
I grew wings and floated up into the sky
Anything is possible!
My heart's dancing, round and round
Let's laugh, La-Pa-Paaa!
I wanna try to make my dreams come true!
All these dreams I have, I feel like my heart's gonna burst
I wanna try to make my dreams come true!
Should we try it? Let's give it a try!
All together, Dancing Heart
Let's sing, La-Pa-Pa-Pa!
