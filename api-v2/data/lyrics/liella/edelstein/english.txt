Walking through this quiet city filled with rubble
I can hear them, voices about to disappear
They are waiting for someone to find them
I will shatter that weakness for you
Shine! I'm going to believe in myself and shine
Proudly, passionately, powerfully, profoundly
My heart burns as I embrace it
I will now try to make this wish come true
And I'll even change these tears into passion
Why does the cold rain continue to fall?
Is it a blessing or a curse?
I'm the one who decides everything
Even my grief is fake
I'm sinking to the bottom of the ocean floor
If I keep trying to reach the light,
Surely I can become a true gemstone
Time won't be able to take away this feeling of longing
I'm only yearning for the dazzling seasons
I'll overcome this by myself
Shine! I'm going to believe in myself and shine
Proudly, passionately, powerfully, profoundly
My heart burns as I embrace it
I will now try to make this wish come true
And I'll even change these tears into passion
