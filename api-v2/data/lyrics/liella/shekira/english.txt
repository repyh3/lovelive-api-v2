Shake it up! Dance!
Shake it up! Dance!
My heartbeat's tied up
Shake it up! Dance!
Shake it up! Dance!
What's gonna happen? I'm in doubt
Hey, I just came up with
A wonderful way to become one with you
Every day's an experiment
Love is a challenge
Yes, we are dreaming monsters
My heart is fluttering
Even after twelve o'clock, you won't wake up
Are you ready to be enchanted?
Come on, with me, just dance together with me
I want to continue dreaming tomorrow and even the day after!
I'm sure that this happy feeling at the party
Makes me realize that I'll forever be close to you
I'll never let you go again!
Shake it up! Dance!
Shake it up! Dance!
My heartbeat's tied up
Shake it up! Dance!
Shake it up! Dance!
When loud bursting rainbow crackers
Suddenly color the world,
It's such a fleeting moment, when it changes
Then next time it's either hit or miss?
What should I do? Which's better to choose?
That there is no, no change because of love,
It's also so good!!
We look at each other and somehow wink,
That's enough to make this place a dance hall
And our hearts began to make noise
Come on, with you, let me dance with you selflessly
I want to remain happy tomorrow and even the day after
I'm sure this heartsy and bluesy feeling
Will turn into a smile as it sways
Hey, do you want to dance?
It's so much fun that I burst out laughing
I feel like my cheekbones are cramping from this
If only this present could continue
Always, always,
Connecting your heart
With the many hearts you'll meet next
Come on, with me, just dance together with me
I want to continue dreaming tomorrow and even the day after!
I'm sure that this happy feeling at the party
Makes me realize that I'll forever be by your side, always!
Hey, try and have a little bit of faith in me
Let's continue to dream tomorrow and the day after
I'm sure that this happy feeling at the party
Is the only thing that will shine forever, at any time
This is the treasure that gives me courage
I'll never let you go again!
Shake it up! Dance!
Shake it up! Dance!
My heartbeat's tied up
Shake it up! Dance!
Shake it up! Dance!
