That reassuring gaze you'd always given me
Gives me the courage to keep pushing forward
Just hearing you kick back and laugh
I feel like I could do just about anything!
Even the sun is jealous of your and my passion
Even when we're apart, we're connected
The waves in our hearts ebb and flow at the same times
No point in hiding! Let's run in barefoot!
Our youth's a party time!
Let's get hyped and shake it up! My heart's pounding!
Those old memories that hurt to think about, they'll melt into the seafoam!
You're like an endless summer☆sunshine!
Big cheers to this excitement!
This season's been like a kiss from the gods
And I love it a lot!
Full of thanks, let's high-five!
The feelings you gave me run deep and hot
Just feel it, fall in live!
The sands of time flow by steadily
Soon enough today or even tomorrow will be behind us
That's why I want to really enjoy myself!
The dolphins do a groovy jump
Bringing us round and round! How exciting!
I've got it, and I'll give it to you too; the greatest happiness!
I'm like an endless summer☆ocean
Let's dance and splash about!
Let's have an adventure under the sun together
Let's say good-bye to our tears!
I'm feeling pretty refreshed right now!
I can't really put it into words right now, but I want to believe this is fate somehow!
Let's get ultra hyped, like boom! (Boom!)
I've got a good feeling, like flash! (flash!)
We'll go over the rainbow, I believe we can do it!
You're like an endless summer☆sunshine!
Big cheers to this excitement!
This season's been like a kiss from the gods
And I love it a lot!
Full of thanks, let's high-five!
The feelings you gave me run deep and hot
Just feel it, fall in live!
Together forever,
Let's have a smilin' live!
