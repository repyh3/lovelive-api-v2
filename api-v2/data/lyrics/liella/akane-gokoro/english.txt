I don't want to let go
It's easier to walk away, but
If I let go of what I love,
I won't be able to see the new dreams that await me
The treasure map that I found one day
Still points to it, saying "here it is"
Let's go find it, c'mon
I'll chase after that longed-for dream
It's not a mistake, don't try to change it
Keep passionately believing in what you want to believe in
I won't mock your passion
Just do what you think is right
It got dark, and there was no one around
But I didn't feel alone; I felt accompanied by the tomorrow that came next
At that moment, the fiery red sky
Was being painted by the light
Even after being exposed to the rain,
My feelings remained clean
It's never too late to
Rise and begin to shine
I remember the constellation of stars
That gave me hope at the time
I'll walk while looking ahead
Even if I can't connect with my soul
The story repeats itself over and over again
But this time, if no one enlightens me, I want to be the one to do it
I was able to move forward because I was with you
Let's smile inside this bright red
Some things can't be changed, so don't blame yourself
Let me see your true desires
"I can make them come true now", you mutter to yourself
Prove it, prove that you can do it
Now that you've shattered your fears, you'll burn even hotter
This is no mistake, you won't make me change my mind
I'll firmly believe in what I want to believe in
Let's embrace our distant past,
Even if it's turned into fragments
It got dark, and there was no one around
But I didn't feel alone; I felt accompanied by the tomorrow that came next
Being drawn by the light,
My heart was dyed red hot and burned
