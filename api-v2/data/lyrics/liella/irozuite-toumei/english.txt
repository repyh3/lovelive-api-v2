I don't remember when I first saw you smile
I'm not sure why, but want to get to know you better
I love the strange feeling of floating in the water now
Where should we go? I'm not sure yet
Maybe we should try moving through these glimmering bubbles
I'll dye this freedom in all colors of the rainbow
An unimaginable future awaits us
Nothing will change. Our hearts will always remain transparent
So don't worry about a thing
I want to sing out loud, so please listen to me even if I'm not very good
Will I be able to find my true self by starting out this way?
I reach out to the cloudless sky, and grab hold of something
Your right hand holds the faint hopes that follows my every move
It doesn't matter what our feelings look like
We'll change so we don't lose our grip on them
Even if a big wish is born someday, just like today
Please be the closest to me
When I feel anxious about the speed at which I'm getting to know those various lights
I try to remember the first time I was happy
The excitement I felt when I jumped into tomorrow without knowing what's in store for me
So, I'll dye this freedom in all colors of the rainbow
An unimaginable future awaits us
Nothing will change. Our hearts will always remain transparent
So don't worry about a thing
