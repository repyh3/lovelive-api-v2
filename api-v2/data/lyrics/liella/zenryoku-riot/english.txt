It can't end like this
It's just a feeling slipping away little by little
I have to be as strong as
The number of scars I have
Even if you can't see them, they're in my heart
If I just follow the template perfectly,
What would it mean to be myself?
Let's go, we're rockin', rockin'
More, we're knockin', knockin'
Come, we're breakin', breakin'
I want to keep playing with you properly
I want to give in to my own impulses
I want to see this show time called life
Rockin', rockin'
Knockin', knockin' harder
Breakin', breakin' the doubts
Without any defense
I want to riot at full throttle now, now
Look carefully
The shape of feelings are distorted, right?
I'm looking for words that fit together
Even if I tried to glue them back together while they're scattered,
I knew they wouldn't reach you
I always knew
My true essence finally breaks through the walls
I want to be my true self, even if it's ugly
We were rockin', rockin'
We were knockin', knockin'
We were breakin', breakin'
Let's prove it
Even a single impulse is real courage,
The spirit is firm and sincere
Rockin', rockin'
Knockin', knockin' harder
Better yet we're breakin', breakin'
Turning the mode up to full power
Even if I'm ridiculed for my lack of experience now, now
I will bring it all down
Imitating others is wrong under no circumstances
Even if you're good at deceiving others
A feeling of déjà vu that only you possess
Will corrupt those parts that haven't yet been covered
So stay exposed just as you are
Do I look like a fool?
Ah, not quite like that
I want to scream louder
I want to keep playing with you properly
Rockin', rockin'
We can't convey anything unless we growl
Rockin', rockin'
Knockin', knockin' harder
Breakin', breakin' the doubts
Without any defense
I want to riot at full throttle now, now
Look carefully
