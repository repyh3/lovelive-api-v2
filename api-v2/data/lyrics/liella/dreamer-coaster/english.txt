I felt a gust of wind coming from the south
On the day you appeared right before my eyes
The sign of a new start rang throughout my ears
As we slid down the rails of our dreams
The things that make me happy, the things that make me sad.
All the different worlds out there:
Let's dash right through them
With no fear in our hearts!
Speeding up gradually, we're a roller coaster
I wonder what kind of future awaits us
After a steep climb, we plunge right back to the bottom
Then make a 360° turn
The things that get me excited, the things that get me anxious
Let's enjoy all of them together!
The deep blue sky with not a cloud in sight
Makes me feel like I've grown to become stronger.
Even if it's just my imagination, that's okay
I'll dash through the curves with all my might!
Clapping my hands and shaking my body
Takes these feelings I can't put into words
And lets me share them
With you whenever I want!
Basking in the moment of radiance, on a roller coaster
We'll aim for a point beyond the rainbow.
After floating a little, we'll sink down gradually
Then have fun as we turn upside-down.
As long as I'm with you, as long as we're together
I won't be scared of anything!
Where will the track we're on take us?
Not even God gets to decide
Our tears and smiles will create the future
Yes, that's what I believe in
I'm dreaming about us being a roller coaster
I wonder what kind of future awaits us
After a steep climb, we plunge right back to the bottom
Then make a 360° turn
I feel exhilarated when I'm with you
I've been glowing since I met you
The sparkles cannot be stopped
The things that get me excited, the things that get me anxious
Let's enjoy all of them together!
