The future is a gust of wind
Calling out to us
With no one knowing for sure what awaits us in the end
But I'll push ahead anyway
Because I don't want to regret
There's no way to hold back our beating hearts
So let them run free!
After deciding to never give up
We'll be able to do our best
In both times of tears and laughter
Pushing ourselves beyond the limit!
Believing truly is the most important thing
Make sure to tell yourself that
And reach towards someplace even further away
Even if we're still nobodies, our dreams span far and wide
We won't be kept down, so let's all fly up high into the sky!
Our memories become gusts of wind
Pushing our futures into motion
With all kinds of surprises along its path
Even then, I want to push ahead
To look what I love in the eye
There's no way to hide our true selves from our hearts
So let's face our dreams head on
I don't want to run away!
As long as we accept that
I'm sure we'll find out what drives us forward
So let's challenge ourselves!
Meeting you changed something in me
And I'm sure your future has changed too
So let's grab hold of an even warmer light
Even though we're still nobodies, we'll make a huge dream come true someday
I'll give it my all, so let's all fly up high into the sky!
The future is a gust of wind, blowing freely without a care in the world
Let's fly high and even higher up, tracing out paths to our dreams!
Believing truly is the most important thing
Make sure to tell yourself that
And reach towards someplace even further away
Even if we're still nobodies, our dreams span far and wide
We won't be kept down, so let's all fly up high into the sky!
I'll give it my all, so let's all fly up high into the sky!
