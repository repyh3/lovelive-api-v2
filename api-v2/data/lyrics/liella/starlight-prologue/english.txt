The twinkle in my heart was but a tiny spark
But it burnt bright with passion, longing for it to come true
Charging ahead without hesitation made me think I can do anything
Meeting you gave me the courage to do just that
You gave me a push on the back at the very start
So now it's my turn to do that for you
We'll create a future where there's never a cloudy day in sight
Where we can go wherever we want
Looking for light
Our story's prologue has finally come to a close
We'll realize any miracle, no matter how impossible
Collecting every last dream scattered about the sparkling sky
We'll make them come true
One by one
Our wishes that are tied tightly together
Will change into a shape you never imagined
I've poured my heart out, and laughed when our eyes met
Every single moment we spend together is precious
Whenever I look back,
I see you with a smile on your face
I want this moment to last forever
So I'll become a stronger version of myself
Going the way
What color will tomorrow be?
Our endless hopes and dreams are overflowing
Surely the world will sparkle brightly
We'll tell you about a heartbeat
You don't know about
Should my trust ever threaten to waver
I'll put my heart into song for the world to hear
I'll save my tears for the happiest days of my life
That's the promise I made to myself
Looking for light
Our story's prologue has finally come to a close
We'll realize any miracle, no matter how impossible
Collecting every last dream scattered about the sparkling sky
We'll make them come true
One by one
We'll trace out the path of light together with you
Forever and ever more
