I changed my shoelaces to something I like
And I'm ready to jump right into the sunlight!
The breeze dances through my shirt
I'll be able to see you soon
My headphones play my favorite song.
You know, the one you taught me
That's right!
I tightly embrace the blue sky
Looks like I'll reach you any time now, and my heart sparkles in response
You make my heart throb; I can't stop it
I'm sure this season will get even hotter
I'll jump over the sun and sparkle with you
A melting sorbet, a spoon floating in the air
We talked so much about trivial things
And about the things we want to try
To the point that I even forgot to eat
I was waiting for something good to happen
So, I say goodbye to those days now
That's right!
I was enchanted by you all of a sudden
It's about to start, right? My heart is sparkling
You give me this burning feeling
This season will go beyond time and shine forever
I'll go catch the sky that's above our heads
I stretched out my arms with my heart sparkling in response
You make my heart throb; I can't stop it
I'm sure this season will get even hotter
I'll jump over the sun and sparkle with you
My heart is sparkling!
