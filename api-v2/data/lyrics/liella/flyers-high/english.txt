I've tried too hard, and for some reason, I'm now stuck in place,
Why, oh why is this happening?
Even when I dash forward at full speed, my spirits stay down,
This isn't an easy problem to solve.
But, now, now, it's okay! My life is wonderful,
For every time we fall over and cry, we get stronger,
So we'll dream, resolutely.
Come, now, lah lah lai, let's take flight.
Surely, ahead of us lies a future we don't yet know.
Burst through the clouds, and we'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,
This time, lah lah lai, you're up!
Grasp on, tightly,
And we'll cross over the sea and the sky,
That's right, this is our flyer's high!
If there's even the slightest chance waiting,
Take it! Try and go.
No one knows the answer, so that means
That everything is the right answer!
Let's believe in ourselves, okay? Tomorrow will be bright.
Our antennas spring up, yearning
To experience all kinds of thrills.
The time is now, lah lah lai, let's surpass our limits,
There's nothing we can't do.
If we take off the limiters on our hearts, the possibilities will be endless.
Let's go on, lah lah lai, and welcome the things
That we've left behind somewhere.
I'm waiting for you, who hasn't changed,
Let's go, higher, that's right!
There's no point if we go about this halfheartedly!
Swish, swish, we'll fly around this earth,
Our dreams are our wings.
Come, now, lah lah lai, let's take flight.
Surely, ahead of us lies a future we don't yet know.
Burst through the clouds, and we'll hitch a ride on the jet stream.
This time, lah lah lai, you're up!
Grasp on, tightly,
And we'll cross over the sea and the sky,
That's right, this is our flyer's high!
We'll soar through this vast, lofty, towering sky,
Let's dream with this passion burning bright.
Ahead of this vast, lofty, towering sky,
An exhilarating tomorrow awaits!
