Good-Bye (Good-Bye)
Good-Bye (Good-Bye)
Good-Bye-bye, farewell my love
I can tell it's you just by the sound of your footsteps climbing up the stairs
You're so special to me, it almost hurts
If you take this hand, then it'll be the beginning of a sad dance
It's begun (begun) beneath a starlit mirror ball
We're just too young, what is there that we can do?
The ribbon (the ribbon) of love (of love), we can't tie it back together
Teenage (you and me) loneliness (loneliness)
You were the one that I loved
Your beauty really makes my heart flutter, Mon Amour
I had a dream (I had a dream) but tonight (but tonight)
Is the night we say goodbye
With one cross turn, I looked back... Good-bye
"Someday, I'm sure" is what I thought to myself, smiling with my cheeks
Stained with chalk dust as we drew our dreams out on the blackboard
But still, it's so cruel, I'm all alone on this wide rooftop
Why's that? (Why's that?) I'm a melancholy supernova
The one who picks up and folds the jersey you threw off
Is me (is me), you're someone (you're someone) who can't live without me
I say hello (in the night) loneliness (loneliness)
We've drifted apart
Yeah, I really don't like this, I sigh to you, Mon Amour
It's the last (it's the last) number (number)
We're almost at the end
I took a step forward, and when I closed my eyes, it was good-bye
Teenage (you and me) loneliness (loneliness)
You were the one that I loved
Your beauty really makes my heart flutter, Mon Amour
I had a dream but tonight is the night we say goodbye
With one cross turn, I looked back... Good-bye
I'm having to bid this youth you gave me good-bye
