Why do I keep fixating on the broken parts of me?
It's probably because I know what perfection looks like, but even so, it's okay
Although I'm far from a miracle that could
Put an end to someone else's doubt
I'll still stay by your side through the rain, until we find our way
If your wish lies in the blue sky and you're reaching for this hand
Take it with you, everything, everything
I'll block out all of your fears, even if they're apart of fate
I will protect you forever and ever
Don't lose to this ever-changing world - not today, either!
I've long since outgrown the boxes they put me in,
Now I'm heading beyond what words like "precious" can describe
When you start wishing for someone else to shine bright,
That's when you've become a true friend
And, I'll prove that there's not a single cloud of doubt in my heart
Now, let's dive into the blue sky and if you're ready to take my hand
I'll do it all, everything, everything
What's so wrong with being weak? If you feel like crying, then cry and scream
I won't mind, forever and ever
Whoever you are... it's enough, so show me the real you
Even if our days shatter apart,
I'll show you I can bare it all
If what you want is the sun,
Then you'll need to be a vessel that never breaks
If what you want is a clear and peaceful present,
Then watch me, watch me, I'll change everything this instant
When I look up into the blue sky, I see a brilliant red light
Take it with you, everything, everything
I'll block out all of your fears, even if they're apart of fate
I will protect you and I'll support you
There's a place for you here, so don't lose! Not ever!
Heading towards the blue sky
