As the seasons before us pass by in a flash
Smiles precious to me gather day by day, shining bright
The one who made me feel all warm and tingly on the inside
Is none other than you, so thank you for all you've done
The autumn breeze, the clear blue sky, this apprehension in my heart
Let's put all those things without form into song
And connect them with our hearts!
The crescent moon slowly fills up as the peaceful nights go by
May we be together always, exchanging words under the moonlight
May times like these continue on forever, 11th moon
Regardless of all the promises we made, time will undo them
But I believe it's our resolve that ties us together, that's my truth
That's why I want to say, "I want to be by your side forever" all over again
I'll keep tying us together, please don't let us come apart
Sharing the same gaze, our hands held tight, and that tender warmth
Let's write down the things we've discovered for the first time
And weave it into a tapestry of our future
The moonlight softly falls over the night hushed in sleep
I want to count all of our cherish memories and talk about them
Let's make a wish so that the dazzling brightness spreads even more
Encounters are just the sort of
Coincidences that happen all too often
But you are the one who turned it all into a miracle
I want us to truly trust one another
The crescent moon slowly fills up as the peaceful nights go by
May we be together always, exchanging words under the moonlight
Before long, the moon will become full and then, I suppose, begin to wane
Even so, let's keep singing with our hearts intertwined
May moments like these keep on shining, 11th moon
