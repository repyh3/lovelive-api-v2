Show me how your trembling heart
I don't want to be the only one trembling
A floating heart floating heart
A floating heart floating heart...
From the very beginning I understood perfectly
That you have a rather difficult character,
But sometimes it wears off, which makes me smile
And your wry smile is already...
Too cunning
I want to take one step further
I boldly sent you a message
The temperature difference between our hearts is so sad
Why, why is it the more I get closer to you,
The higher you build walls and run away?
I feel that there's a kind version of you
Hidden behind those harsh words
See you later, we parted so coldly
On opposite platforms
But you're waving your hand at me vigorously
So that made me think
That maybe you still like me after all
A floating heart floating heart
A floating heart floating heart...
As a standard way of creating a deep connection,
I try to confide my worries to you,
But you don't always answer me seriously.
It hurts so much because it feels like you're deceiving me
Because of you,
My heart keeps spinning and changing constantly
It's like a kaleidoscope
I want to see the world as beautiful as possible
Why, why is it when I move away from you,
You show such an innocent face?
Even though you pull away as soon as we get close,
Don't make me wait, now I can come back
Why, why are you like this...?
I think about it so much that it's annoying
Why, why do you always
Keep such a calm and serene expression?
Here I am, trembling in solitude.
Please don't build any more walls
See you later, we part today too from opposite platforms
You keep waving your hand at me vigorously
Now I finally understand
It's okay, no matter who you are, I like you after all
When can we see each other again?
Someday, you'll smile kindly at me
I have a feeling you will
So I'll wait, forever
