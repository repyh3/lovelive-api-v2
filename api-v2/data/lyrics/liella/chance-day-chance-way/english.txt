Is it okay to dream? Is it okay to go wild?
You don't need to worry about that, you can always just ask your heart
It'd be a waste if you don't try things out freely! Let's jump
Every time it's a festival, now, let's show some courage
Hurry up and come on over; let's all get wild and wilder
Let's head over to the other side of this excitement; sure, why not?
We just wanna throw off our coats, y'all, yay! And let's have a ball!
Yes! I want to know about you!!!
The day we met is truly a chance day!
It's no coincidence, it's fate
Let's dance and repaint the world (fully, fully, colorful)
Our feelings overlap, chance way!
And our energies connect
Let's do something absolutely amazing
Let's keep chasing after the things we unconditionally love
Even if you can't change everything right now, just keep going
If you're in trouble, just send out an SOS, I'll be there in a heartbeat!
Everybody is connected; c'mon, you can put your trust in me
There's something that we don't understand fluttering inside of us
Maybe if we shake our bodies, we'll figure it out!
It's important to go all out, yay! Let's sweat it out!
Ah! I keep coming up with things I want to do!!!
When we laugh together, it's a chance day!
Our fate is starting to move
Let's set our eyes on the future (fully, fully, colorful)
This must truly be a chance way!
Our sound is ringing out loud right now
We're heading towards the sunshine
Everyone has it in them (even you)
That spark of hope (show it off some more!)
Shake it off (the barometer) and give it a try (if it's you)
Yeah! (Yeah!) Yeah! (Yeah!) Make some noise with everyone!
C'mon! Let's chat and dance the night away!!!
The day we met is truly a chance day!
It's no coincidence, it's fate
Let's dance and repaint the world (fully, fully, colorful)
Our feelings overlap, chance way!
And our energies connect
Let's do something absolutely amazing
Let's sing and get excited together
It's a festival, so let's become one, yay!
