Shining feelings are born in the depths of our hearts
We'll try shouting even louder
To create this universe with you!!
wow wow wow wow...!!
Countless stars are shining again tonight
Throw away any doubts about your aspirations
The power of words that you give me
Always feel like an unexpected gift
Even when I stop, it reminds me of
The reason I started running...
C'mon, blow down the wall that separates us, and let me hear your voice better
So that our mood to dream never fade
At the moment, when we shouted together, we undoubtedly felt
Warmth and love that live in our palms
Call my name again and again
Nothing can separate us now!!
I was delighted with the little box that day,
Because I didn't know what would pop out of it when I opened it.
Even now I still cling
To my empty curiosity,
As if I can't take my eyes off
The incomprehensible future
Even if I'm scared alone, when I'm with you, I can dive headlong into this
Even if standing on tiptoe, we can fly by supporting each other
When our hearts are tied tightly, we want to feel the joy
That washes over us all the time, because we can do anything
Let's run through this starry sky without rails
At superspeed, while holding hands
Every time our voices overlap, our feelings become one,
Our lives shine brightly and smiles overwhelm us
The universe that seems so ordinary, but not at all ordinary,
We create it together, we'll make it shine, this universe!!
Wow wow wow wow...!!
Wow wow wow wow...!!
Wow wow wow wow...!!
Wow wow wow wow...!!
Blow away even your confusion and let me hear your voice better
So that our mood to dream can be heard for miles
At the moment, when we shouted together, we surely feel
Warmth and love that live in our palms
It will spread endlessly, this universe!!
Nothing can separate us now!! Wow...!!
Wow wow wow wow...!!
