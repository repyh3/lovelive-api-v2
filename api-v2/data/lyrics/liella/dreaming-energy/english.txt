Wow... Dreaming!
Wow... Dreaming!
When I'm walking alone
I come up with many things I want to do
Can I really do them? "Of course!"
I wonder whose voice it is that answers me
I can't stay calm
When there's such a good weather in the city
Almost like something was about to happen
As I gradually start to run,
I feel I could meet you by chance at any time
Listen, please listen!
I want to start it all today, but
Ah, I still can't say it properly
I have (Dreaming) always had it (Dreaming)
In my heart; this dreaming energy
Listen, please listen!
I want to start it all today, so I want to tell you right now
If we all connect,
We can do a lot of fun things together. I'm sure of it!
Wow... Dreaming!
Wow... Dreaming!
I came up with many ideas
I greedily want all of them to come true
I can do it, right? "Of course!"
Every time I make more wishes, I become more fearless!
The straight contrail in the sky
Is continuing on to a faraway place
Something is going to happen, so
Let's try more and more new things
I want to do a lot of challenges with you!
Let's go, c'mon let's go!
I'm loving this so much
Let's chase after it and jump out
Surely (Dreaming) in my heart (Dreaming)
I want to create this dreaming energy
Let's go, c'mon let's go!
I'm loving this so much, that's why I'm always laughing
If we're all connected,
We can do a lot of fun things tomorrow. Absolutely!
Let's go, c'mon let's go!
I'm loving this so much
Let's chase after it and jump out
Surely (Dreaming) in my heart (Dreaming)
I want to create this dreaming energy
Let's go, c'mon let's go!
I'm loving this so much, that's why I'm always laughing
If we're all connected,
We can do a lot of fun things tomorrow. Absolutely!
Wow... Dreaming!
