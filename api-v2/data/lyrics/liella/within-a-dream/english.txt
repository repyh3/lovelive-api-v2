Within a dream, let's dream
I always, always miss you
Today was fun too
A lot of things happened
Maybe in bed
I will remember it?
I always want to be by your side
There are so many things I want to talk about
Before you know it, look,
The night is already falling
I can't wait
For tomorrow morning
(I can't wait)
Giving wings to what I love,
I will let it fly free.
Within a dream
Let's dream together
Only in the waking hours
I can't keep up with my feelings
When I whisper: "Good night",
Our hearts will call each other and connect (connect)
They will fly over the twinkling constellations
Closing my eyes,
I will say: "Good night"
Now I will meet you
After I parted ways with you
At the end of the day,
I started moving again,
Only when I saw your face
When we're apart,
What should I do with the words that come to mind?
Hey, until I deliver them to you,
Please, don't disappear
There is no tomorrow,
I want to say it right now
(I want to say it right now)
While they are bright and beautiful,
My thoughts, like comets,
Fly through the air in an instant
(Dream within a dream)
(What kind of dream will I have tonight?)
The sky, which connects us, used to be separated,
Gently sparkles even in the dark night (sparkles)
Let's make everything we want to do come true
(It will come true within a dream)
Within me again
A nameless feeling is born
Closing our eyes,
Let's dream together
Hey, I will always be here
Within a dream
Let's dream together
Only in the waking hours
I can't keep up with my feelings
When I whisper: "Good night",
Our hearts will call each other and connect (connect)
They will fly over the twinkling constellations
Good night, I hope tonight
I can meet you within a dream
