On days when the sky breaks out into tears
Helplessness grips my heart; that's how I've always been
But you're always there with a smile
Staying by my side until we could see the sky again
I wonder when it started, but there came a time
When I lashed out every time I saw your smile
Even so, you remained your kind self
Which hurt me all the more
I hate you, can't stand the sight of you
Lost count of how many times I thought that to myself
But I can't take it anymore, why do I feel this way?
I look up at the cloudy skies, all alone
Fun memories of all the time we spent together
Fill the streets, forever unchanging
Of course we got into fights once in a while
But we'd always apologize at the very end
You gave me so much courage
But all my heart could offer in return was the cold shoulder
I can't become true to myself, not anymore
I can't even bring myself to say "thank you"
I hate you, can't stand the sight of you
It'd be great if we never ever met again
"I miss you", the words slipping out from my lips
Get drowned out by the sound of the pouring rain
I'm sure, I'm sure
That these feelings that I've given voice to
Will never disappear
I hate you, can't stand the sight of you
Lost count of how many times I thought that to myself
But I know full well, that deep in my heart
I actually really, really...
I love you, I really love you
Even when I try to hold them back, the words fall from my lips
I can't wait to see you again, I wish you'd appear right away
I'll tell you how I truly feel
But for now, I'll close my eyes, waiting for the sky to clear
