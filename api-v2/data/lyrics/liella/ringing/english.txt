All the things I want to do, but can't for some reason
Just make me sigh over and over again
Trying too hard to become someone I'm not
Just trips me up, filling me with frustration
Without ever catching a break
The second hand races round and round the clock
Each time a thought pops into my head
I hear the ringing of a tiny bell
I'm having so much fun, I'm just so happy
Even the remnants of my tears fill me with pride
The tiny bell, fairer than the flowers you see there
Let them bloom all around, let them ring!
I'm no one but myself, different from anybody else
I just need to do my best, take things at my own pace
I know that full well in my head, but somehow
I just can't help comparing myself to someone else
This feeling of uneasiness spreads throughout me
Even as end the day with room to spare once again
Every time I move forward one step at a time,
I hear the ringing of a tiny bell
Even when I lose my way, even when I worry
I'll make sure to keep dreaming of a brighter future
Hidden in every single place that I visit
Is a happiness that makes my heart sing
Whenever I search or feel for it, I can't help but laugh
I'm going to keep ringing my heart's bell
Look, a thought pops into my head
I hear the ringing of a tiny bell
I'm having so much fun, I'm just so happy
Even the remnants of my tears fill me with pride
I can still do this
The tiny bell, fairer than the flowers you see there
Let them bloom like I do, let them ring!
