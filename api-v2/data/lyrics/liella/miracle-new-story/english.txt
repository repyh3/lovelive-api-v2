The feeling like I'm capable of anything,
It turned out to be stronger than I expected,
Because I've just realized
That there are so many things I'd like to try
Let's try something
I think doubting is a waste of time
A story that set in motion,
This is where this miracle story begins
So, so let's dream
If our hearts flare up strongly,
The impossible will become impossible, and coincidence — fate!
So let's enjoy it
Loudly, loudly sing with us
I want to have fun with you
Cheer up, everyone, if we sing cheerfully,
We won't stop smiling
Come on, loudly sing with us
You too join us
More adventures await us tomorrow
From now on we will overcome them together!
When I can believe in myself and in my dreams,
Deciding that somehow everything will work out,
If you say there's an open door,
I wonder if this will pass to you?
Somehow everything will work out
Cares? Impatience? Share everything with me
A precious story,
Where will this miracle story reach?
Always, I want to always dream
I feel like I'm floating in the sky
Off-road is our road and fickle future!
So let's enjoy it
The voices of all, the voices of all join mine
I'm very happy about it
Today I will be cheerful again, if we sing cheerfully,
We won't stop loving it.
Ah, the voices of all join with mine
Your and my voices
Will certainly reach anywhere far away
So let's start a new journey
So, so let's dream
Always, I want to always dream
Only the power to dream always remains unchanged
Loudly, loudly sing with us
I want to have fun with you
Cheer up, everyone, if we sing cheerfully,
We won't stop smiling
Come on, loudly sing with us
You too join us
More adventures await us tomorrow
From now on we will overcome them together!
MIRACLE NEW STORY
Let's enjoy it together
Let's have fun together
