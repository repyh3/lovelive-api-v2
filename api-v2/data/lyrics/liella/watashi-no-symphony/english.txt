Like a child who has found a treasure
I started to play my dreams
I'll make my glittering hopes resound
So that it can be heard everywhere, my symphony
I had always treasured
What is most precious to me
But when I wondered how to make it come true,
I stopped because I didn't know
One day an opportunity
Suddenly landed in front of me
Although it was different from what I imagined,
I slowly raised my arms towards it
One clumsy step forward
Can change the world in a flash
What's waiting for me? What can I do?
Gather courage and move forward
I'm no longer the insignificant me of yesterday
Since I've started to play my dreams
The curtain rises, what awaits beyond
Is the stage that I drew in my heart
If I take a step towards it,
Even what I thought was impossible will come true
I'll make my glittering hopes resound
So that it can be heard everywhere, my symphony
If I could send a message
To the hesitant me from the past
I would tell her "I'm having fun now!"
After all, my heart is beating this fast
That girl who seems able to do anything
That girl who never stops laughing
Despite being worried, despite feeling lost
She never loses sight of her dreams
In order to someday find
The perfect phrase for myself
Even if it's the first time, I'll take the challenge
Please let my prayer reach you!
I listened carefully to the melody
That is being played someplace faraway
Let's open the door to the unknown
I won't ever let this symphony end
I join together my right hand's little finger and my left hand's little finger
While I make myself a promise
"I will never forget these feelings"
I'm no longer the insignificant me of yesterday
Since I've started to play my dreams
The curtain rises, what awaits beyond
Is the stage that I drew in my heart
If I take a step towards it,
Even what I thought was impossible will come true
I'll make my glittering hopes resound
Let's make them spread everywhere
Lalala Lalala Lalala c'mon!
Lalala Lalala Lalala
Towards a new me
The symphony is starting now
