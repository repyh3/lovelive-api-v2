What is lying in wait for us!?
As of now, nobody knows, and it's not fun to not know!
Heading towards that excitement,
Let's run together beyond the colored cities
I wonder if it can or can't be done, but that feeling is the key
Though I'm catching a star that I can't reach now
I will never give up!
The power to dream (the power to dream) lets us believe (we've decided)
I want to fly higher and higher with you now, would that be okay!?
Together (together), on this new story (riding with the wind)
It's time for us to get started, so let's go
What a Wonderful Dream!!
I never imagined that this day would come
Let's go and find the future we've never thought of
Because I want this happiness to be spread all around
I feel so happy, I can't contain my emotions
And I want to share them!
I want to change (I want to change), even if I can't change (by all means)
Let's put aside the feelings of being stuck in this moment
Let's aim for (let's aim for) the next place (we won't stop)
Life continues to be a wonderful surprise
What a Wonderful Dream!!
I want to do countless more things
Let's reach out to them with good greed
Our dreams (our dreams), our dreams (our dreams) call, infinitely spreading
I'm sure (I'm sure) in my heart, as well as yours, (sleeping)
We've got the power to create a world-changing miracle
Together (together), on this new story (riding with the wind)
It's time for us to get started, so let's go
What a Wonderful Dream!!
Let's believe in the power to dream
What a Wonderful Dream!!
