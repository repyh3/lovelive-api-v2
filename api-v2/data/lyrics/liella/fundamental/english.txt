I always want to see everyone's smiling faces
I was trying to act stronger than I am, but...
I want to include myself into "everyone"
And be part of that happiness
I used to wish that I could someday be like that,
Back in those sunny days
I feel like I've already
Gotten a little bit closer
Hey... will you listen to me?
For the first time, I've found the future I want to walk toward
So, I think I'll try being selfish and greedy
When I know this is what I want, I'll grab on and never let go
Being sincere and single-minded is fundamental
Even if I had just kept walking along that path,
I'd still arrive at a wonderful place
Even though I understood... I still chose to turn around and walk away
I really tried but I just love it too much
You know that some things aren't as simple as they're made to sound
But, freedom is about continuing to make your own choices
That way, if something sparkling calls out to me
I can take it head-on, and that's the fundamental thing
It's because you called my name and refused to give up
And because you took my hand
That I am still here
And that I still want to make my dreams come true
My policy is to keep running until it becomes real
For the first time, I found myself among countless futures
So, I've decided that I'm going to be as selfish as I can!
Have I gone past the point of fearing for what the future brings?
Of course I haven't, but that's also what excites me
When I know this is what I want, I'll grab on and never let go
Being sincere and single-minded is fundamental
I've made my choice; I'm not going anywhere!
