Beyond the dream I'm chasing, I'd always see
This star called hope, and because it shines, because it shines
Even if I stumbled, I could keep moving forward
Just where am I headed beyond this dream I'm chasing?
We'll get lost again among our encounters
But we can enjoy that, too
When you're able to do something that you thought seemed possible but wasn't
It makes you so happy that you want to work hard and your heart wants to pop out
We want to tell everyone to laugh more and sing more
So let's keep going even further
The world keeps expanding and some of the scenery might change
But our passion will never change!
I want to chase the dreams beyond the obtainable dreams
I won't give up, I won't give up
But you already know that
When you think something is impossible, just give it a go instead!
You can understand your feelings by getting rid of the doubts in your heart
We want our dreams to come true by overcoming a lot of frustration
Those wishes will shine so bright
I wonder what kind of excitement we'll play tomorrow
Let's change the future!
I'm proud of myself for having the courage to start from scratch
Since I'm working hard today, I'll keep struggling until I reach my dreams
We want to tell everyone to laugh more and sing more
So let's keep going even further
The world keeps expanding and some of the scenery might change
But our passion will never change!
There are dreams we want to see come true by overcoming a lot of frustration
Come on, everyone, let's make them come true
I wonder what kind of excitement we'll play tomorrow
Let's change the future! We keep chasing our dreams!
