Hey, we could meet again in a dream,
Where we held hands all the time
(Why?) Even when I woke up,
I still felt so sweet, I remembered your warmth
I like a fool can't open up to anyone,
But I'm slowly coming back to reality
The sad words of a song that I somehow spilled
Pierce my heart
"I won't haunt you anymore" —
No matter how much I convince myself of this,
I only want to see you even more
If falling in love allows you to fly in the sky,
Please, give me wings,
Because then I will love you even more
Everything is so ambiguous,
That it stretches this period
(That's how) I won't pick your favorite hairstyle no more,
I'll even erase your birthday from the calendar
A rainy afternoon soothes me,
Because laziness and loneliness are similar
Even if tomorrow is sunny,
There's no need to reveal
My current true feelings
"I want to leave you", "I want to forget you" —
Even if these words alone keep us apart,
They still gently caress my heart
But, if only we had the same dream,
I like a child would to hold on to a faint hope, ah.
Is it harder to think about you all the time
Or stop doing it?
I do not know that,
But I want to send you,
A light breeze that is blowing now
"I won't haunt you anymore" —
I mumble again today
"I won't haunt you anymore" —
No matter how much I convince myself of this,
I only want to see you even more
I fell in love with you, which is so sad
Please, give me wings,
Because then I will fly right away
