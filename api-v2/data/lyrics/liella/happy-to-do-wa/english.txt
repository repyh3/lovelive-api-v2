Hey! I really really like this one!
No way, you have terrible taste.
When we're together, we go shopping.
It's definitely, "Wa Wa Wa", very rowdy.
Noisy shubidu! This or that.
Chit-chat chit-chat! You don't say.
How long will it take for you to decide?
I sigh, knowing this may take a while.
HAPPY TO DO WA! I feel dizzy,
Everyday is like a roller coaster.
And yet, for some reason
When you make me laugh, it's such a wonderful feeling♪ Hey!
I can't stop feeling happy!
There's no time to stop and breathe. Let's keep having fun!
Open your heart, and the future will open
Right now with a bang!
Why don't we just jump on in?
Ah! Shubiduba! Shubidu! HAPPY TO DO WA!
"Let's go somewhere else," you say? Then that's the last store!
This way! Over here! We can't come to an agreement!
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to decide the winner.
And no matter who wins, "Wa Wa Wa", don't complain!
Noisy shubidu! Oi...
You cheated!? Hey!!
It doesn't matter what you do, it's all the same in the end
It's all one big rowdy mess anyway.
HAPPY TO DO WA! Our tendency to go wild
Varies wildly,
But even so, when it comes down to it, we're pleasant.
We're bound together by a mysterious thread! Oh!
Our happiness won't stop!
Don't stand there, confused, let's play!
Our hearts are colorful,
And just like that, always,
Why don't we snuggle up close to each other?
I wish these amazing days
Could last forever
Let's make it happen then!?
HAPPY TO DO WA! I feel dizzy,
Everyday is like a roller coaster.
And yet, for some reason
When you make me laugh, it's such a wonderful feeling♪ Hey!
I can't stop feeling happy!
There's no time to breathe. Let's keep having fun!
Open your heart, and the future will open
Right now with a bang!
Why don't we just jump on in!
