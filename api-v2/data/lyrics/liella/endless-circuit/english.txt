Rolling up my sleeves
And nailing a perfect rocket start
Waving at your shocked face as I pull ahead, Go! Go! Go!
I've prepared all I could for this day, so I'll believe in myself!
In just a moment, we're bumper to bumper
Casually drifting to the side to avoid you
In this unpredictable race, as we compete
I learn a good thing or two about you
We'll forever
Run and fight! I can't lose
Run and fight! Especially to you
Because you're the best rival I could ask for
That I'm sure
Run and fight! Even when I stumble
Run and fight! I can keep running
And it's all thanks to you
May the sparks continue flying tomorrow on this circuit
Always going full throttle
Nothing can stop me once I get started
Don't mind all the times when I slip up just a little, Go! Go! Go!
I'll never forgive myself if I let you take the lead!
Cutting you off with a spin
When either of us is in a pinch
We help each other out
Since life's boring without you around
Always, we'll
Run and fight! I can't lose
Run and fight! Especially to you
Because you'll forever be my rival
Forever and ever, we'll
Run and fight! Even when I trip
Run and fight! Let's continue running
Together with you on this circuit
