Time seemed to pass faster than usual
This winter
As you point towards the light in the distance
Our breaths fog up before our eyes (shimmering and sparkling)
We'll walk through
The familiar streets holding hands
In our uniforms
Our worlds will begin anew this spring, it's just so exciting (so exciting)
I don't want to leave you, I'll be lonely for sure, just a flake (of snow)
Flutters to the ground
Even though it happened so recently, it's so strange
But it's already so nostalgic
Maybe it's because I'm not thinking about this very moment
But instead, trembling at what's ahead in the near future (trembling)
I'll take another step forward,
It's coming soon
But now...
Every day with you by my side is so precious (so precious)
The feeling I've learned is fluttering in the white sky, just a flake (forever)
I want to be with you
(Passing us by)
We open the door to meetings and partings, and move forward
But what must remain unchanged is that our hearts are connected
Our worlds will begin anew this spring, it's just so exciting (so exciting)
I don't want to leave you, I'll be lonely for sure, always
Although I want to keep laughing with you like this, just a flake (of snow)
Is melting softly
