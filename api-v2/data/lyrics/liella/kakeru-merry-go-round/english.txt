The sun yet makes another round as dawn breaks, dyeing the sky in a faint purple
The sounds from the boisterous crowds of midday scatter the clouds located high up
We used to always look up at the sky together, didn't we?
As dusk falls, the streets finally light up
We're but wooden horses, spinning round and round together
Not getting closer nor further, not going faster nor slower
Sharing the warmth of our bodies as we go round
Dawn breaks yet once more, searing the sky in a blazing orange
The silence of midday douses the flame, leaving a world awash in a pale blue
What we see changes bit by bit without us noticing, doesn't it?
As dusk falls, shooting stars light up the night sky
We're but wooden horses looking right after each other
Even if they seem the same, every day I spend with you is different
I etch each and every one in my heart as we go round
Spinning round and round through time
Let's go on a journey that'll never end together
We fly beyond the starry sky
The merry-go-round of dreams won't stop spinning
Even if they seem the same, every day I spend with you is different
We'll keep making it, forevermore
Come with me
