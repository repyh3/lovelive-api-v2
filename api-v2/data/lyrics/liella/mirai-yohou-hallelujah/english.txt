I'll shout out my love!
Facing my dreams head on, it's all I can do!
Feeling uneasy like a burden
Hiding my feelings for what I care most about
Deep down inside though, I want to ignore that
To do my best, even though it sends down shivers
A gust of wind blows through,
And it makes my skirt flutter
And then, it hit me
I can make a change!
I'm not gonna hold back my feelings
For what I love anymore
(Even if I might cry)
I'll chase after my dreams
I'll transform into a new feather,
And fly into a new sky!
(I can already hear it)
My future's forecast is sunny Hallelujah!
Not even one second can be wasted
Instead of worrying about my mistakes, I just change my direction!
It doesn't matter if I stumble, as long as I keep pushing ahead
The more I see, the more I can see the next scenery
The hustle and bustle of people begin to sing
A melody flows through the city
The excitement is so close
That I can feel it gently pushing against me
I'm going to take what I love
And run with it
(When I decide to do something)
I'll go all the way!
If this song exists,
I can do anything if I put my mind to it!
(My heart is filled with it)
A sound that resonates, Hallelujah!
No matter how high the wall is,
I'll climb over it
I'm not gonna hold back my feelings
For what I love anymore
(Even if I might cry)
I'll chase after my dreams
I'll transform into a new feather,
And fly into a new sky!
(I can already hear it)
My future's forecast is sunny, Hallelujah!
I'll believe in myself, Hallelujah!
