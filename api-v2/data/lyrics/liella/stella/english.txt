It sparkles in our hearts
Embracing all sorts of emotions as I walk
The night makes it feel like I'm in outer space
I'm drifting away. Where am I now?
When you feel anxious, just look at the big sky
I'm here!
I'll always be by your side
With both hands raised, I release my light
Look at the vast sky. There's no cloud in sight
Trust me, tomorrow will be a sunny day
Why are you happy about trivial things?
Maybe it's a sign that things are about to change
I see that light shimmering in your eyes
I want it to shine on everything right away
Pointing to the faraway future with you
Embracing the light that won't fade away again
The sky is like glass, even on a starless night
We're here, sparkling ever so brightly
Faster. Faster. I want to shine more.
I know I have it in me to make it happen.
Can you feel me standing by your side?
With both hands raised, I release my light
Let's go anywhere together beneath this vast sky
Trust me, tomorrow will be a sunny day
Let's believe, c'mon!
It shines in our hearts: Stella!
