The whole world is watching you
Dance freely
It's okay if you make a mistake,
You're dancing, dancing
Spending every day comparing answers,
I'm just upset, are you too?
There is certainly no standard answer
Trust the thrilling feeling in your chest
Today we have today's vector
It's normal that it's different from yesterday's
Let's keep moving forward with all our might
I don't want to be bound
By the words "I won't falter" anymore
The so-called rules
Don't bother me
Dancing, dancing, raspberry; now
Dancing, dancing, raspberry; come on
Let's dance while holding these red fruits
Yeah, it's easy, really, see?
Dancing, I feel raspberry love!!
I am the best!
Even if I make a mistake,
I'm dancing, dancing
It's better to have fun than to pretend to have fun
I don't belong to anyone but myself.
The gradation of the sky reports the current time
Capture it with your eyes instead of taking a photo
What kind of person are you?
What are you interested in?
Since I let the love that has many aspects blossom,
Which naturally cannot be expressed in one word,
I want to eat with you,
Trembling with pleasure
Dancing, dancing, raspberry; that's why
Dancing, dancing, raspberry; come on
Show me more of your fruits
Yes, it doesn't matter, really, all of it.
Dancing, love raspberry kiss
Doing something unfamiliar is also normal
I want something, I don't know what, but I want it
I'm so excited
Try to slip into
The crack that's opened in my heart
Don't think! Feel me now
I keep waiting for raspberries, hum, yeah.
Dancing, dancing, raspberry; now
Dancing, dancing, raspberry; come on
Let's dance while holding these red fruits
Yeah, it's easy, really, see?
Dancing, I feel raspberry love!!
I am the best!
I want to feel it
