My heart is a little difficult and short;
However, we exchange words and thoughts
(oh oh oh oh) I can't express mine well, though
I suddenly hid in the glass ball
Inside me is a gentle, little world
(oh oh oh oh) Time stops
I'm glad I didn't hear anything
Although no one understood what I said
That's why I can't do it now;
I can't be alone, I can't go back
On that day when I was singing in the glass
My voice, your voice;
They connected together and broke me out of the glass ball
I finally became free and gave all of my gratitude towards you
Glass ball rejection
You, who opened a hole, shouted
"Please come out more soon"
(oh oh oh oh) Can I believe you?
The colors that spread the moment you stepped out
They shined my future in radiant light
That's why I can't do it now;
I don't want to lose everything; I can't go back to get it back
On days when I was looking blankly beyond the glass
A dream that touches the wind; it shines
Since when did you live in my heart?
What is the identity of that dazzling star?
I can't laugh, don't laugh
Inside the glass ball,
I was alone, but
I noticed you were by my side
You can change the sparkle I'm seeing right now;
More vividly, show me a bright world ahead of me
That's why I can't do it now;
I can't be alone, I can't go back
The world I'm now in is dyed with a bright red
My voice sings out to you
And it blended with the outside world
The feelings that sprouted for the first time smile;
Glass ball rejection
