Hey, I still remember the first time we met
Down to the very words you said
It all feels like it was just yesterday
A panorama filled with color
We'll take a trip down memory lane aboard a Ferris wheel
After making a whole round, we'll continue making our way up
Towards a brand-new sky
Yes, when I lost confidence in myself
Your voice sounded so kind
You didn't overreact, you were the same as always
Thank you for smiling at me
All kinds of us come and go
Even the most common of things are so special
I wonder what you'll be like when I see you again
Ah, the breeze blows through the same city
There's only a few unfamiliar faces
I'd love to be able to look at
This kind of scenery with you, forever
We'll take a trip down memory lane aboard a Ferris wheel
We've done a whole round, but let's continue going up
Towards a brand-new sky
Our story will continue
