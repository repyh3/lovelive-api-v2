No matter how many times, yes, how many times we lose heart
We'll overcome it every single time
Let's hold hands, and shout: "Fight!!"
Resonate; fighting call
Even if I chase you, you're still far away. And time moves on, stopping for nobody.
Because of the inner struggle and reflection my dream is blurred.
We are here. Find us, look, we are here.
I believed that it was enough to take one more step and everything would change.
It arose after the sparkling rain,
It's still imprinted in my eyes, the panorama I saw that day.
How many times, how many times have we risen again?
Shedding many tears, we became stronger.
Days like these are also our treasures.
No matter how many times, yes, how many times we lose heart
We'll overcome it every single time
By placing our hands on top of each other
Just a little more. I want to watch you make
Different facial expressions.
Just a little more. I want to dream, and shout: "Fight!!"
Resonate; fighting call
There's no use starting over. Today is just today.
How many dozens of times have you forced yourself to go through this? How many hundreds of times have you regretted it?
The day you can step up to the next stage, you'll probably grow wings.
Pure joy erases worry.
Our wounds remain in the same place.
We have a deeper bond than just laughing together.
Let's go far away
Yes, over the rain, ah.
It's okay to be unsure (it's okay).
Courage is something we give to each other, and that's enough.
If we can say: "Fight! Fight!"
We should have even more fun.
I want to more greedy with you
And grasp the future.
Step by step I'm convinced we've taken the right path.
How many times, how many times have we risen again?
Shedding many tears, we became stronger.
Days like these are also our treasures.
No matter how many times, yes, how many times we lose heart
We'll overcome it every single time
By uniting our hearts.
A little more. Watch me make
Different facial expressions.
A little more. Watch the miracle that blossomed thanks to our tears:
This beautiful rainbow.
I want to dream, and shout: "Fight!!"
