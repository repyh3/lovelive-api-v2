Our hearts have no shape
It's hard to hold onto them, isn't it?
Words are the only thing keeping them together
But they keep slipping through the cracks
Where are you? I'm right here.
Continuously repeating beneath the starlight
Our eyes have just met now, look
We laugh for no reason
I thought I loved you
I found something, something solid, I'm sure
Let's have our feelings connect just like this
Like we're saying each other's names
Always by each other's side, and looking at each other
It's a simple thing, yet so important
Kindness and strictness
A distant memory that rests in my heart
I can feel your pain, look
It spills from your eyelashes
If that drop is you then
You don't have to say anything
I'll find the real you by fumbling around
As we huddle together
Our eyes have just met now, look
We laugh for no reason
I thought I loved you
I found something, something solid, I'm sure
Let's have our feelings connect just like this
Like we're saying each other's names
During these intersecting moments
We can no longer communicate
Our feelings
