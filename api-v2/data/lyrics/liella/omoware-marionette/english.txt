In this love we share,
There is a longing that is overflowing
Strings are pulled tight by a dark allure
Each time I swipe,
You say "wait" with a smile
As I stare at the screen
I'm checking these feelings to see
If anything's slipped through without me noticing
(Jin-Jin) I guess nothing has shown up
(Jin-Jin) While no one's looking,
Our hands meet beneath the desk
Marionette (net) net (net)
I'm controlled by longing, this is getting dangerous (barely avoiding)
There's no way I can control this (no way) not when we both feel it
You'd think of me (me) me (me)
But even that unspoken rule is fading (ah)
"This love will forever be our secret"
As this thread steals my reason, and is pulling me along
Sometimes I drop hints
Because I just want to tell someone
That's such a contradiction
A thrill-seeking game? That's not it.
This comes from something real - something pure
(Jin-Jin) In the moment we passed by each other
(Jin-Jin) You winked at me twice
Does that mean you like me? Can I take it that way?
Marionette (net) net (net)
Romance pulls my strings, and dares me to be bold (a nervous fidget)
We can't let anyone know (not yet) even though we're in love
So delicate (yeah) yeah (yeah)
We danced without even having to write a scenario (ah)
"Our love is eternal and unbreakable"
I don't need any proof. This feeling is more than enough.
This feeling is precious (it really is precious)
I want to keep it hidden away inside its box
Even if I wish for that...
Marionette-net
In the end, I've been controlled by longing (it's obvious)
If I could keep it under control (yeah, right) we wouldn't be in love like this
You'd think of me (me) me (me)
But even that unspoken rule is fading (ah)
"This love will forever be our secret"
As this thread steals my reason, and is pulling me along
Strings are pulled tight by a dark allure
