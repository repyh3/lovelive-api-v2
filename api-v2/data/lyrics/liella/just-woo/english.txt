Make-up's perfect, rocking my glasses,
Let's tear up this Friday night
I'm not really here for anything,
I just felt like walking past the giant city screen
The lively street-side BGM
Feels strangely nostalgic
Oh stop it, this perfect happy ending is
Really giving me courage again
Currently making good on every word, I'm a dream-chasing fighter
I'm updating my winning streak, I don't feel like I could lose
I've fallen in love! Right now, I'm totally obsessed with myself
I've fallen in love! Once I'm under the spotlight, then I get serious. Yeah!
Fake humility? That's just not my thing
I'll sing and show off all my charming points
Come on now, just woo!!
I'm making my appeal, I've gotta win the future over
Making things happen is my style
Even through the glass, I can still feel their eyes on me
I'm giving off an extraordinary aura, don't you agree?
It's okay to be narcissistic to a certain extent
It gives me power, my battle buddy
I've fallen in love! Right now, I'm madly in love with myself
I've fallen in love! I won't turn away, I follow my voice, always. Yeah!
Spinning round and round are neon lights, with arms wide open, let's go
Get ready, just woo!!
Scattering the stars, the future waves me forward
I'm going to make it come true
Up the stairs, one, two, three, jump and strike that pose!
When that horn rings out, I can still feel that moment resonate with me
It's like a tiara of pride shining inside me
I've fallen in love! Right now, I'm totally obsessed with myself
I've fallen in love! Once I'm under the spotlight, then I get serious. Yeah!
Fake humility? That's just not my thing
I'll sing and show off all my charming points
Come on now, just woo!!
I'm making my appeal, make sure you watch carefully!
Making things happen is my style
