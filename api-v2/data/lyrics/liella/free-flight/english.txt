It has already become problematic enough, I constantly hesitated,
At what as a rule for the sake of someone else and not for myself
I thought there must be a way to make everyone smile,
I've been looking for it all the time
So you you, it's you you
You told me that I can't keep going like this
You you, yes, you too
You expect me to smile too, don't you?
I feel that now I can fly far-far away
Having ran out through that door
And surrendered to the power of the wind that blows my heart, now I'll take off
Yes, it's free flight
Gradually we'll find the places that each of us aspires to
But this will not be bye-bye, this will be for the sake of a new meeting
So you you, with you you
We made a promise, so let's fulfill it
You you, yes, you too
If it gives someone courage
I can fly anywhere far-far away
Having left behind the times we were together
And grasped with both hands the wind that blows into the future, now I'll take off.
Yes, it's free flight.
When the dawn comes, the stars will disappear
And we can see the sky they've been drawing all along
Its blue skies
We take a run up, we can fly far-far away
Without looking back at that door
And having surrendered to the power of the wind that blows my heart, now I'll fly.
Yes, it's free flight
Lets take a free flight
Not for the sake of someone else and for myself, I'll fly
Yes, it's free flight
