Endlessly, without aim
There are feelings burning up
Though they can't easily
Be put into words
I'm trying to confirm their strength
Hey, can I
Move forward more?
Surely, strength isn't something you learn
It's a dormant instinct
Camellias bloom in my heart
A melody of wild winds is blowing
I should be able to surpass it, if it's me now
This predestination
Is it okay if I keep praying
For just one selfish wish?
"You can't see dreams unless you're foolish"
It's like whispers are guiding me
If you're going to get hurt and give up
Then you never really wanted it from the start
I've resolved myself somewhat
Thinking I'll keep smiling
I'm going to clash with it
Hey, I want
To stay here
With sensations, trembling fingers
Let's begin now
Camellias awaken in my eyes
Reflecting only tomorrow's future
Even without being wrapped in a sweet scent
Now, individuality
I'm crying because it won't come true
But I have a premonition
"My heart is still looking ahead"
It's like whispers are comforting me
The charade of being a good listener is over now
I don't want to lose you, only you...
Camellias bloom in my heart
A melody of wild winds is blowing
Because I promise to overcome it
This predestination
Is it okay if I keep praying
For just one selfish wish?
"You can't see dreams unless you're foolish"
Guided whispers
