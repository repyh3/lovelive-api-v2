Let the melody you gave me and my song come together as we walk along
Whenever we lose our way on this map of hope we drew out as kids, I always envision it within my heart
I was able to do my best because I was timid, and I wanted to become stronger
On the day I was able to believe in myself a little, the wind blew
The sky stretches across endlessly, but just how far does it go?
I want to know, because our journey has only just begun
I want you to continue to smile even more, so I'm going to try to go even further
I can hear it; now, let's hold hands and run towards the future
When I count the stars, everything seems to twinkle
I decided that even if I'm troubled, I'll always love what I love
What melody will I come across tomorrow? I don't know yet
I want to sing the phrase that makes my heart beat the loudest
There's surely a new light on the horizon
It's waiting for us, so let's all keep an eye out for it
Just having fun won't get us past this point
But having fun is what pushes us forward
Let's fly while embracing these precious feelings
I can hear the sound of the future
The sky stretches across endlessly, but just how far does it go?
I want to know, because our journey has only just begun
I want you to continue to smile even more, so I'm going to try to go even further
I heard it; now, let's hold hands and run towards the future
