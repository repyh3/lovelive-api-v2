Once you take but a single step inside
There's no turning back
I wonder where the exit could be
As uneasiness pushes me forward
Anything and everything that gets thrown in my way
I'll overcome them with a spirited shout
Holding your hand,
We make our way through the convoluted paths
Should we head right? Or should we head left?
I'll just trust my instincts!
Days!
We constantly live out our lives
Without knowing what is in store for us
As we fumble through every second of our days
Maze!
Even so, we have no choice but to continue forward
Through this long, intricate maze
At the very end of this road
We'll definitely see the bright blue sky above us
In the alleyway enveloped by darkness
I find a door, hidden from view
Throwing it open with joy
Only to find myself back where I started
"We'll be fine, let's just keep going!"
Your unwavering voice calls out to me
Giving me the courage
To press onwards once again
Is this a shortcut? Or is it a detour?
I have no idea, but let's find out together!
Days!
With each day that goes by
We'll challenge ourselves to do something new
It's fine even if we get it wrong once in a while
Maze!
That's why I won't be afraid
Even in the depths of darkness here in this maze
At the very end of the road
We'll definitely become stronger than we were before!
The road stretches on endlessly
It may appear to be cruel
But I'm sure the days where I lost my way
Will become something that I'll cherish forever
Days!
We constantly live out our lives
Without knowing what is in store for us
As we fumble through every second of our days
Maze!
Even so, we kept laughing
As we continued forward through this intricate maze
At the very end of this road
We'll definitely see the bright blue sky above us
