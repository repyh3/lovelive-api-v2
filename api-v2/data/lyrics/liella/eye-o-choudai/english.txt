I always attack on the sly
I can't stand it, if you'll cross a dangerous bridge
I won't let you reveal my true face
My antenna has excellent sensitivity
Even the smallest trifle
I want to find, I want to know, so make a fuss
Although trying one or the other is quite painful
But, if I decide to do it, I must see it through to the end
Eye, eye, give me your eye
I need more and more of your smiles
It's kind of a life-threatening mission
Be on the center of my lens, I shoot
Eye, eye, give me your eye
I need more and more that I haven't seen yet
Why am I so desperate chasing this?
This is the great secret!
I always casually strive to take the best position
Ah, as soon as our eyes meet,
As my lens twitches and my heart begins to beat faster
I think that lies should always be mixed with a little truth
But it's quite complicated, so I just say everything frankly
I won't give up, it's just that my route is different from the route of others
I'll definitely get where I want to go
High, high, make it high
Raise the tension more and more
Let yourself be careless, and I'll steal, you'll see,
Your image, which no one knows yet
High, high, make it high
Let me watch you more and more
Why am I so obsessed with this?
This is the great secret!
It's so strange,
I'm afraid that you might recognize the real me
It's so much fun, that I think:
«I don't need anything else»
And still!
Eye, eye, give me your eye
I need more and more of your smiles
This kind of life-threatening mission,
Can I change, if I complete it?
Eye, eye, give me your eye
I need more and more that I haven't seen yet
For some reason I want you to see through
The real me
But it's still the secret
