We'll meet up fifteen minutes earlier than usual today
I skip through the station gates, excitement bubbling in my heart
Let's not think too much about where we're going
What's important is that I'm here together with you
What does our future look like? I can't really tell yet
But if there's one thing I know for sure, is that I really like you
I'll cross every intersection with a spring in my step no matter what
Weaving through the gaps in the crowd pushing me back, is this what it means to be free?
Slightly ahead of me, you turn back with a mischievous smile on your face
Even an ordinary today feels extraordinary when I'm with you
Our friendship will never die!
With only unanswerable questions on our lips, we go around in circles
Fingers catching against the grooves of a water bottle sweating in the sun
Time always seems to fly by when having fun, doesn't it?
With our hearts empty of worries, we bounce off each other in a sparkle
Enjoying each and every second, as if dancing to a slow rhythm
I wonder, will there come a day when I reach out only to find that you're no longer there?
But that doesn't matter for now! With my eyes set on the sky dyed a deep red
I make a promise to you at the top of my lungs
That this moment will be eternal!
I wonder, just how far does the world extend?
I have no idea, so I'll focus on the present, together with you
I'll cross every intersection with a spring in my step no matter what
Swimming against the wave of people pushing me back, right here in these streets
Slightly ahead of me, you turn back with a mischievous smile on your face
Even an ordinary today feels extraordinary when I'm with you
We'll be friends forever!
