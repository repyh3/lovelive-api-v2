Never forget what you saw that morning
When you first set out on your journey
When excitement washes away your uneasiness
The starking contrast of the streets
Crossing bridge after bridge, heading towards the future
When a brush of sadness
Reflects upon the deep blue sky,
I whisper to myself:
Even if I cry, the seeds of my dreams will eventually bloom
So there's nothing to be afraid of, I'll just have to keep going, right here and now
Never forget what you saw at night
That made you feel happy
City lights bloom like flowers,
And trees sing in the wind
Let's climb the steepest hill!
But one day the clouds covered the
Gentle glow of the stars
Even though I'm feeling lonely
When I cry, a rainbow of my dreams will eventually form
So there's nothing to be afraid of, I'll just keep hoping, right here and now
Even though we're far apart, we're still looking up at the same sky
Because I cry, the seeds of my dreams will eventually bloom
So there's nothing to be afraid of, I'll make a promise right here and now
I'll definitely make my dreams come true
