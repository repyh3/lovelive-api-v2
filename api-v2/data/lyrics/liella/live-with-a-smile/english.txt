There's something you need to know, forever and always
We'll be singing right by your side, forever and forever more!
Wow wow wow Wow wow wow
LIVE with a smile, smile!
Wow wow wow Wow wow wow
LIVE with a smile, smile!
The light we saw at the very start
When we reached out towards it, that was when it all started
Where does our courage lie? Right here, within us!
It burns hot even till this day
Wow wow wo, if we sketch out our dreams
Our hearts, dancing with happiness, pain, and sadness
Wow wow wo, can never be stopped
So let's set off, as far as we can possibly go
We've always been and will always be running through the seasons
When the radiance within us first came to life
There's something you need to know, forever and always
Our feelings will be one, so we'll continue singing, forever and forever more!
Wow wow wow Wow wow wow
LIVE with a smile, smile!
Wow wow wow Wow wow wow
LIVE with a smile, smile!
After the rain, a rainbow appears in the sky
Let's cross it together, now that the skies are clear
Like how the sun shines down hope on the stars of tomorrow
Ah, the world truly is connected as one
Wow wow wo, our dreams will never disappear
No matter how many times they quake and waver
Wow wow wo, we will not be giving up
We'll do everything we've ever dreamed of doing
Our dreams and miracles
They live alongside the radiance, they live in the now
No matter how far they seem, we'll chase after them, forever and always
We all feel the same way, so we'll continue singing
The sounds of prayer turn into song
That wish of yours will come true someday, you'll make it come true
So put on a smile, we'll set off together!
We'll overcome everything with a smile, so let's set off together!
We'll set off with the sacred passion in your heart
Let's sing until we meet our dreams for real
The light we saw at the very start
When we reached out towards it, that was when it all started
We'll change the future with our courage... We'll definitely do it!
We've always been and will always be running through the seasons
When the radiance within us first came to life
There's something you need to know, forever and always
Our feelings will be one, so we'll continue singing, forever and forever more!
Wow wow wow Wow wow wow
LIVE with a smile, smile!
Wow wow wow Wow wow wow
