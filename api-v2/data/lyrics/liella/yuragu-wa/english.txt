I felt like I could do anything
(I'm not lying) in that moment
When I'm with you,
(A flame starts to burn) in my heart.
And yet, no matter how hard I tried
(What will you do?) I can't go on.
This isn't what I imagined
(Reality is) harsh.
It happens so often that I can't even
Tell you what's troubling me
You tell me to smile while saying "it'll be okay".
It's not okay!
Flickering; it always happens
Flickering; I've hit a roadblock
We're like a small fire that's about to be put out
I don't feel confident!
Don't flicker; it's tough, but
Don't flicker; it's burning all over me
I want to believe that our passion can be reborn
What do I really want?
(To be honest) I don't know
The reason for my existence, needing self-affirmation
(This really is) quite confusing
It's faint, but I feel a hint of courage
(Light the fire before you leave)
My endless crying and cowering
Will smother my dreams
Flickering; I did it again
Flickering; like a light in the wind
It shouldn't be such a big deal,
But my heart is aching!
Don't flicker; when you say
Don't flicker; that I am weak,
That's when the real challenge begins
The story that I longed for
(The hero) is always portrayed as
(Stronger) and braver than anybody else
(Maybe) they were also weak and vulnerable
(Perhaps) we're not so different after all?
Just kidding, I'm starting to feel feverish again
A flickering red flame,
I have something I want to do
It's burning away my inferiority complex
I should keep moving (but...)
Flickering; it always happens
Flickering; I've hit a roadblock
We're like a small fire that's about to be put out
I don't feel confident! (I don't!)
Don't flicker; it's tough, but
Don't flicker; it's burning all over me
I want to believe that our passion can be reborn
