Twirling around, spin, future!
Twirling around, let's search for the future!
Let's enjoy ourselves together, forever. (Forever! We'll be happy, happy!)
We thought that, but... (suddenly trouble comes rolling our way)
With a woosh, a gust of wind comes, blowing it away (Bye-bye! We're happy, happy!)
And just like that, we're in the midst of an eddy of wind.
What should we do now? I have no clue what's going on anymore,
Even if I reassure you, pretending to know what I'm doing.
Where is the future? We're twirling around.
I can't see it at all, so I'm on the edge of my seat,
Where are we going? We're spinning round and round
If this is a dream, then awaken from it!
Close your eyes, and grab hold of your future!
When I open my eyes in the morning (Mornin'! Mornin'!)
I'm in a strange land, one that I've never seen before (The world is glittering and colorful)
All we've gotta do now is go forward, yeah? (Ok! Mornin'! Mornin'!)
Let's start this adventure, me and you together
This is a place where impossible things happen, all the time!
Even if you're scared, you can't say that, yeah?
Let's go twirling forward, no matter what happens,
We trip on a pebble, staggering,
Pay attention, spin round and round,
Once we overcome this spot of trouble, what lies in wait for us?
Oh no, it's another crisis!
Twirling around, spin, future!
Twirling around, let's search for the future!
These circles don't have an end, so I'd rather just enjoy them!
I've got you, and these strong feelings, so I feel like I can do anything!
Now then! Let's jump right in!
Believe in the future, spin and twirl,
We're looking forward now, excited for what awaits!
I'll go, with you, spinning round and round.
Let's make a pinky promise, and once we've done that,
No matter if we're lost, or down, don't ever let go of these joined hands.
Let's search for the future, let's go!
