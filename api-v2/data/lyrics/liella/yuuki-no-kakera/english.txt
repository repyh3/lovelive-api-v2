Hey, if I can do one thing, I will push myself to my limit
That way, I can't say that I hate myself anymore
Once I've decided
To face these hurdles
I just have to go for it without hesitating
And so, the temperature will slowly rise
I'll gather the fragments of courage and hold them up to the sky
Hope will reflect its sparkle all over the world
I'll try my hardest and keep going until the very end
I'll make it happen, no matter what - that's what I've decided
On days when I've worked hard, the sun sets gently
Even if I can't do it today, there's always a tomorrow
I won't hide how I feel
I'll just admit that I feel "frustrated"
This feeling lights a fire inside of me
I gotta go right now! Run with these feelings
These fragments of courage may be shattered, but they won't be defeated
My dreams will always shine in the seven colors of the rainbow
I'm serious, really serious - I believe in myself
I swear I won't stand around, no matter what
I've been looking for something unshakeable
I want to have the confidence to say, "I'm here"
I'll gather the fragments of courage and hold them up to the sky
Hope will reflect its sparkle all over the world
I'll try my hardest and keep going until the very end
I'll make it happen, no matter what - that's what I've decided
