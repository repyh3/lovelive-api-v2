Good morning to this world full of noise
What will it be, what will it be today as well?
My tail swings diagonally to suit my mood
Stop it with a kiss, xxx
Even if you try to look shy,
Even if you stand on the sidelines,
Time just calmly continues ticking
Sugar cubes, dissolving
In a glass mug cup,
I think they are similar to our lives
Endless things don't bring satisfaction
This tension is just a melody
Make it sound with the faint sound of six strings
Oh oh oh
Hey, nothing, nothing, nothing, I still have nothing
"Nothing, nothing" is a description of my every day
But I'll turn this terrible day into my strength
I stepped on this distortion with force
Let's kick the noise away
Curvaturism is so annoying, but cute
Play the guitar
I'm just praying for metamorphose
These days, sweet as chocolate,
I tried to somehow escape from them
I already understand
That I'm fed up with them
What kind of self do I want to strive for?
I imagine this as I began to purr
Here's another cheerful restless kitten
Yeah
Yes, no one, no one, no one, I just can't become no one
"Nobody, nobody" is a description of my future
But I'll play, lamenting, with my strongest serve
My stylish strap
Is too long and uncomfortable
Stretchingism inflates — this is description of me
Play the guitar, yeah
Hey, nothing, nothing, nothing, I still have nothing
"Nothing, nothing" is a description of me
But I'll turn this terrible day too into my strength
I stepped on this distortion with force
In the middle of this bustle
I scream that curvaturism is so annoying
Play the guitar
Catch up on, by demanding what you don't have
Catch up on, getting lost is normal
Playing the guitar,
Catch up on, because someday for sure...!
