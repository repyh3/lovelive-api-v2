When trying to touch them with your fingertips,
They quickly fade away
It seems to reach me, but it doesn't
A frustrating distance
A drop of the most beautiful star
Gathered in the palm of my hand
I only wish for one thing;
To see your smile once more
I'll keep dancing, embraced by the slight heat you give me
I wonder if this feeling will grow hotter and hotter
Even on many sleepless nights,
I've been dancing with you, year to year
Before I knew it, I was hooked
By a love that attaches me to you
The balcony at dawn
Is dyed with the color of passion
I'll give you everything I've got
I'll give it to you, so please accept it
In the midst of vertigo, a slight fever softly binds my heart
For you, I will become stronger
I can't stop it from overflowing
I want to stare at you so much so I can get bored
Like that wind, it's passing through me to you
I dream of the day when my feelings reach you
I'll keep dancing, embraced by the slight heat you give me
I wonder if tomorrow will be even hotter
I wonder if I'll be even more attracted to you than today
It'll get hotter and hotter... Someday...
I believe my wish will come true
