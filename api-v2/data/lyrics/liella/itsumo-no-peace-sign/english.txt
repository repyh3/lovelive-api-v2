Don't complain at all, keep your lofty aspirations on a high heat
Every time I stop, I think: what would you do in this situation?
The unfamiliar scenery that we chase, catch up with and can meet again,
Can differ from each other even more
It crosses the blue sky
This snow-white meteor
Isn't it normal that we each strive for our own future?
I won't lose, so run straight on your path
My heart will always be right next to you
When you're feeling down, just remember
The usual peace sign we made back to back
No void, no distance
When I hear rumors of you working hard, it gives me great strength
Now it's my turn. I will move forward again, you'll see
The messages we send to each other not with words but with effort,
Don't worry, they will definitely get through
They shine and shimmer
The afterimages of our smiles
Don't you want to enjoy the near future?
I must hurry, I have no time to say that I'm lonely
I can always feel the wind that you call
On the way back home amidst the surrounding noise,
Even if we're not together, we make the usual peace sign
No void, no distance...
Look, a few white lines reach for the sky
Now they've gathered into one and are separated again
Isn't it normal that we each strive for our own future?
I won't lose, so run straight on your path
My heart will always be right next to you
When you're feeling down, just remember
The usual peace sign we made back to back
Even if we're not together, I'm always by your side
