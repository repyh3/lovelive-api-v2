My sparkling shooting voice
Will be sent to you tonight!!
Let my feelings fly to you
There's something rather exciting and wonderful
Whenever it happens, I make sure to write it down
Rather it be about a song I love, or the weather
I want to tell you everything as soon as possible
Hey, where are you right now?
In bed? Outside? At a friend's place?
We're still connected no matter where you are
Just listen closely to our special time!
I'll send it to you tonight!
I've always wanted to tell you how important you are to me
My voice is going to soar through the night sky
Shooting Voice!! Hey!
You heard me just now, didn't you?
A feeling that comes and goes in a flash
If I don't say it out loud, it'll disappear
I want you to tell me with your own voice
Don't worry, I'll listen to every word you say
When you can't be honest for some reason
I suddenly think "I'm sorry"
The night when "thank you" just comes out
Is when I want to be close to you; Starting Time!
We'll tell each other tonight
With our own voices while crossing the many streets
The moment it sparkles, I'll jump up
Shooting Voice!! In this moment,
I'll catch you
Even if we can't see each other for a long time (so far away)
If we think about each other, we'll reach each other (send it!)
Because it's something I want everyone to share
(That's right!) (Let's put) (our voices) into the present!
I always feel you
Standing close to me
Let's connect our hearts even more
I'll send it to you tonight!
I've always wanted to tell you how important you are to me
My voice is going to soar through the night sky
Shooting Voice!! Hey!
You heard me just now, didn't you?
May this throbbing feeling
Take flight, Shooting Voice!!
