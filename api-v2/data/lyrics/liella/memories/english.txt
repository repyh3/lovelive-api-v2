Whenever we're happy, we hold hands
Sharing our happiness between us
That's the rule that came to be
Without any of us realizing
When things don't go well,
Just looking at my hands cheers me up
Even the buds swaying in the wind
Bloomed into dignified, beautiful flowers
The joy of but a single moment
Gives me unimaginable strength
So thank you, from the bottom of my heart
For these precious memories
When we're sad, we lean on each other's shoulders
Watching the moments pass us by
Spending time together like we always do
Loosens the threads of our worries
The smile on your face in times of joy
As long as I keep that in my mind's eye
Even the flowers the rain mercilessly beats down on
Blooms bright, believing in the rainbow that'll soon appear
Just a single smile on your face
Gives me unimaginable courage
So thank you, from the depths of my heart
For these precious memories
Even if the thoughts I dream about
Will soon wither away into nothing,
I just need to look at the passing days to remain hopeful
Filled with every single memory,
I'm certain that bouquet I hold
Will shine brightly forevermore
The joy of but a single moment
Gives me unimaginable strength
So thank you, from the bottom of my heart
For these precious memories
