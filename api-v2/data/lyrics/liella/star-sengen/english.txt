We've got to do whatever it takes
There wasn't any choice in the first place
We'll just have to sweat it out and face them again
Again, won't you? Oh no.
There's so much trouble here and there
And there's no way out of it
It's way past our scheduled time, so we're leaving
Leaving, we're leaving.
Why? I'm just working hard to be like this
Surely! I drew a different future
More! I want to laugh as much as I can!
Open your eyes! You'll be the next superstar!
Don't give up now, you want to be the best, right?
Even if you fall, just get back up again
I'll show you that I can turn anything into power,
We won't lose!
My mind is all over the place
I'm not able to reset and the day has just begun.
I don't even have time to nimble on some toast
No time at all? None at all...
I'm reflected in the city's windows
I can't stop laughing at my multiple reflections
I hold onto this small amount of pride and run
I run, run, woah!
Why? No one is praising me
Stop that. I'll keep trying until I've nailed it
That's right! I want to believe in myself
Keep chasing after it! Your very own superstar!
Don't wanna struggle, and I don't want to regret anything
Even if I run out of breath as I run,
Surely a scratch will turn into a medal.
An opportunity is right around the corner
My time has come. I'm going to shine.
Open your eyes! You'll be the next superstar!
Don't give up now, you want to be the best, right?
Even if you fall, just get back up again
I'll show you that I can turn anything into power,
We won't lose!
Wake up! Stand up! Fight now!
