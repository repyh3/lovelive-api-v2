Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be
Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be
It practically takes a genius to be as dense as you
Anyone else would've noticed ages ago
“Huh?”
Pretending it’s a coincidence again today
Should I try ambushing you?
But that’s so lonely
Look over here!
I’m praying, you know
I’m crying, you know (Please)
My love can't, can't bear fruit (can't it?)
Instead of the main plot, it’s a side story (Hey now!)
Fix your habit of going on ahead (I’m over here)
I’m rushing, you know
I’m crying, you know (I've had it with this!)
My love can, can... can, can, can bear fruit?
In short: I like you, so try to like me back (Smooch)
Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be
Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be
I'm trying so hard to make you see, yet you don't get it at all
I keep feeling on edge lately, I just can't relax like this
“Roger!”
You’re oblivious to the point of simplicity
My passionate feelings are lightyears away from you
That's why I have to try and do my best
I want to become your girlfriend!
I’m hesitant
I want to feel it (I want to know)
I can, can be caught by love (I was caught)
The whole novel is probably a love story (Lovey-dovey)
I tried writing it for the two of us (It’s a happy end, right?)
I’m troubled
I feel it (Geez, you idiot)
I can, can... can, can, can be caught by love!
In other words... Say 'I love you' aloud (Hug!)
(Dododododo do dodo do) Do your best
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey)
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey)
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey ey)
A happy ending, right?
A happy ending, right?
Come on, come on
I've had it with this
Geez, you idiot
I’m praying, you know
I’m crying, you know (Please)
My love can't, can't bear fruit (can't it?)
Instead of the main plot, it’s a side story (Hey now!)
