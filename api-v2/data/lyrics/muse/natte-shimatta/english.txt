The wind blows a bit colder today
I was sure of it when I felt it
I really want to meet with you, and I want to do it right now
I can't tell you about the reason
Since when this has happened I also don't know
A thing I can assure you is my heart calling out your name
To think that all of this is too far
May be fault of my own lack of resolve
I want the courage to start it all again
All of this may already be inside of me
Then, if it doesn't awake soon enough, that's bad
I've come to love you more than anything else! (Already!?)
This story from now on I want to create it with you
I've come to love you more than anything else! (Already!?)
The shape of you dreams, I want you to tell me more of them
As though I feel fine when alone
These feelings that never lie
Are dying for meeting you, and they want to meet you now
The yellow gave way to red
As I went through the trees on the road
My eyes are always looking for you, and never forget your shape
If I don't say it you won't ever know it
I murmur as if chanting a spell
Running away as far as I please to
If I say it will they hate me? I start to think
But this timidness I will have to throw away
I want to be the only thing your eyes know (Please hear me!)
I wonder if this decision can be told to you in such a trembling way
I want to be the only thing your eyes know (Please hear me!)
The never ending miracle of seeing you, I want to never fall out of its way
This is what it has become, and there's no turning back (There isn't)
This is what it has become, and I wonder why (In meet you)
There's surely a meaning so please believe this burning heart of mine
I've come to love you more than anything else! (Already!?)
This story from now on I want to create it with you
I've come to love you more than anything else! (Already!?)
The shape of your dreams, I want you to tell me more of them , I want you to tell me more of them!
