Where is this place?
Wait, even if you don't say it, I already know
It's a warm mirage I saw in my dreams
Who are you?
I won't ask because I already know
This is an encounter called forth by our wishes
The first star that shines brighter the further it gets
I always wanted to try a romance like that
My heart's brakes are no longer needed
We were born just to meet and become a pair
Ah! I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that prefers "More"
I won't let my wings be mere decorations
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that likes "More"
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow
But rather the present instead
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped
We've always believed in it and understood,
that our encounter was for us to collide with each other
The colder it gets the hotter the flames of my steps
That's right, I'll bet everything for the sake of love
Come, let yourself be attracted, just enough to get hurt a bit
This sparkling tear, is it from joy or from sympathy?
Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again
We'll have to dance until this passion burns out
Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again
"If you catch me, keep holding on to me tightly," I whispered
This precious dream has yet to end
I knew that time couldn't be stopped
So I wanted to meet you much earlier
I'll let the words I want to convey dissolve into this sound, and Call Angel!
Ah! I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that prefers "More"
I won't let my wings be mere decorations
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that likes "More"
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow
But rather the present instead
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped
