I know happy holiday, happy holiday
Get together at the usual place
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
We talk about whatever we want today, Happy time
The rumored chocolate (Delicious!)
I tried lining them up (Melting)
Love is bittersweet (Together)
So, So, It’s sweet and bitter
Now is everything
Yet I easily worried about the past
It’s weird, Yeah, It’s not like me so it’s weird
I wanted you to listen for a minute to the seeds of my worries
It’s laughable when put into words
I wonder if I can feed them to the birds as snacks
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
It’ll be fun so get together
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
With everyone’s voices, shiny day
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
My heart’s bursting open honestly
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
I love you so it’s great, Happy time
Rainbow-colored macarons (Gimme!)
Mouthful of magic (Gonna disappear)
Easily-broken love (An adventure)
But you know, But you know, I want more
This is now
Dispel the gloom of ordinary days
What? I chewed on it, Is it really like us?
With a superb smile of course I can’t lose
The energy sleeping at the bottom of my body
Unleashed my enthusiastic style
We are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
It’s refreshing moving so cheerfully
You are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
It’s coming to everybody, sunny day
We are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
Let’s bust out into chitchat with honest expressions
You are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
I love you so it’s great, Dancing girls
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
It’ll be fun so get together
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
With everyone’s voices, shiny day
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
My heart’s bursting open honestly
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
I love you so it’s great, Happy time
Choco-Choco-Chocolate (Delicious!)
Maca-maca-macaron (Isn't it delicious?)
Love’s melting (Wanna give it a shot?)
So, So, It’s sweet and bitter
