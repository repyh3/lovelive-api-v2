Not recognizing each other even when we pass by
When we've become adults
Will this all become nostalgia?... I was thinking about that
Because you've always been by my side
I took that for granted
I thought our everyday life of troubles and laughter will surely continue
This feeling of wanting to preserve this fun moment
It's the first time I'm feeling that
Not recognizing each other even when we pass by
I can't imagine a time when you and I become adults
After all, we'll always be together
Though we can't see it, we really have been maturing bit by bit
From the place where we buried seeds
Tiny leaves are starting to sing
I finally noticed that somewhere along the way
The changing seasons had painted the town a new color
I tried calling you within the light filtering through the trees
But the wind unexpectedly drowned me out
For just a moment, the scenery wavered into sadness
I'm just imagining it right, we're still the same as always
Playfully running around until I feel like I'm about to trip
Wait, wait, are you stopping somewhere on the way home?
Not recognizing each other even when we pass by
I can't imagine a time when you and I become adults
After all, we'll always be together
I tried calling you within the light filtering through the trees
But the wind unexpectedly drowned me out
For just a moment, the scenery wavered into sadness
The scenery wavered into sadness
