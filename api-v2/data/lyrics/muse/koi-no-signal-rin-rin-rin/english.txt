Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
If you can hear, please nod and answer!
Please let my ability to find mysterious awaken
I want to feel excited every day
But not because of you...you've got it all wrong!
I'm in a strange mood, it feels like all excuses
I end up calling out to you after all
and laugh as always
Just a little (just a little), my heartbeat's (faster than normal)
Why's my heart racing? Why?
I want to get started now, rin-rin-ring a bell
That's weird...but it's not love, sheesh!
Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
You pretended to not hear, but I kept on ringing
Whenever I feel cramped, I take a walk
My step suddenly feels so light
You're not here, are you? Yeah, you definitely aren't!
What if we met by coincidence? How'd I feel?
I don't want you to feel down
But I'm not interested - it's written all over your face
The truth is (the truth is), having expectations (hurts!)
Can I just dream? Can I?
I wanna make sure, ren-ren-rendezvous
It's so fun...isn't this love?
In my heart, a colorful ren-ren-rendezvous
My reddening cheeks are too honest!
I want to get started now, rin-rin-ring a bell
That's weird...is it completely strange?
Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
You pretended to not hear, but I kept on ringing
Give me your answer, please!
