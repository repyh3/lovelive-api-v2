Chase it honestly, chase it with courage
A small wish will create tomorrow
It’s possible if everyone wants it
Try harder than anyone, maintain your passion
Our aim is the beautiful path where the wind blows
Raise your arms as if they were wings
And fly to the dazzling future
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, it can be heard in that moment
When you smile, everyday will be okay!
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, I want to see that moment
Stay by my side ''(What a pleasant sight)''
And I’ll be by yours
I want to see you honestly, I want to see you energetically
Under the glistening rays of the sun streaming down
What we talk about is everyone’s future
Someone said that things will come true of we believe in ourselves
Perhaps I understand that miracles should be grasped
Take in the frustration
And journey to the world you envision
Finally youth is budding, I want to give you this pleasant feeling
Wherever you are, stretch out proudly
Finally youth is budding, I love this pleasant feeling
You’re really here ''(It’s always lovely)''
And I’m really here for you
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, it can be heard in that moment
When you smile, everyday will be okay!
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, I want to see that moment
Stay by my side ''(What a pleasant sight)''
And I’ll be by yours
