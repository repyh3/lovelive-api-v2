Let’s fight, I say “chance!”
Let’s fight, You know “chance!”
Let’s fight, You gotta chance!!
Pointing at the sky, "Let's soar tomorrow, okay?"
Because it's you who's saying it, I start feeling uneasy (feeling uneasy!)
You're always overdoing it, getting angry for some reason
But I love it when you're laughing
(My chest will tighten… but it’s a secret)
Look over here for a bit (hey hey over here!)
CheerDay CheerGirl! In front of your eyes (Hey hey!)
CheerDay CheerGirl! I want to say it (Hey hey!!)
People who do their best are wonderful, everyone is thinking that!
CheerDay CheerGirl! In front of your eyes (Hey hey!)

Wave your arms and wave your pom-poms, Yay! Let’s fight!
Let’s fight, I say “chance!”
Let’s fight, You know “chance!”
Let’s fight, You gotta chance!!
If you fall down, you’ll pretend to be asleep
It seems like you will do that, but won't you feel sad? (pat pat)
Your zealous face is great, I’m secretly looking at you
Since I want to try taking photos of you
(This firm patience… it’s kind of cute)
Share my vigor (fill it up!)
