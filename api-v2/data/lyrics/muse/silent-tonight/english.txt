To the extent that the words don’t come out
I have kept on running
Because to understand, I’ll ask as it is
“It was truly remarkable, wasn't it?”
It’s fine to put on a composed act
Because no one is watching anymore
Having a worn-out face is fine
I will embrace you tightly
However, at this moment, both our gazes met
We just cuddle ever so softly
I don’t care about the meaning at all, but always
This sweetness will not disappear from my heart
If people did not rely on each other
Working hard would become a habit, right?
But just for a bit, I stop to a halt
I feel like it wouldn't be so bad
I close my eyes and see a floating face
Because it can’t be me, you know
During the times we aren't together, I am also thinking about you
I want to embrace you tightly
A long time ago, “I like you and yet…”
I said that, but now, I still feel the same way
I never ask why it is like this
I want to convey this sweetness from my heart
During the times we aren't together, I am also thinking about you
If I spend time enjoyably, it would be nice
It’s fine to put on a composed act
I want to embrace you tightly
However, at this moment, both our gazes met
We just cuddle ever so softly
I don’t care about the meaning at all, but always
This sweetness will not disappear from my heart
A long time ago, “I like you and yet…”
I said that, but now, I still feel the same way
I never ask why it is like this
I want to convey this sweetness from my heart
Silent tonight wow
Silent tonight for you…
Silent tonight wow
Silent tonight for you...
