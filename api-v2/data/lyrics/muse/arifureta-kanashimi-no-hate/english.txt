I'm sure that I would've been better off ignorant
Holding such pain in my chest,
I smiled each day, not saying a word about it
and told myself to forget
I shut away my memories, heartbreak
With this clichéd sadness and clichéd pain,
I barely hold back tears and watch the stars
They shine brighter than usual, and seem to fall
As they quietly illuminate me...
These feelings will settle down gradually
As time passes, you too will fade
When will this become a distant memory?
Time has passed, you have faded
I repeatedly question why, heartbreak
My never-ending sadness and never-ending pain
Flow like the waves until dawn breaks
My feelings swirl more violently than usual
And I feel as though I could fall apart completely
Should I sleep? The moon eventually grows light
A gentle dream falls upon my chest
With this clichéd sadness and clichéd pain,
I barely hold back tears and watch the stars
They shine brighter than usual, and seem to fall
As they quietly illuminate me...
