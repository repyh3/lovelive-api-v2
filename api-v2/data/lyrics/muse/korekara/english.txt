I'm waiting just like always
I'm waiting at that place
Though we didn't make a promise, I'm certain it will reach you
If I'm waiting just like always
If I'm waiting at that place
You'll come over with a smile, excited and short of breath
While thinking that there's always later, every day is flowing past
I want to treasure the present at least; We can't return to this moment
The seasons are passing by, everything changes
It's natural, yet my heart feels slightly lonely
Your feelings, just how far would you go chasing them?
We've come so far since when we first met and decided to be together
Ah, surely you... feel the same...?
We can meet just like always, right? (With everyone)
Because we can meet at that place (It's alright)
With a smile, we can overcome the future (the future)
The sky at the end of each day illuminates us
The evening sky beneath which we talked about tomorrow is extremely nostalgic
Holding on to our wishes (our wishes), spinning the threads of our dream (sparkling)
It's wonderful; See, your heart is searching for the next (the next) story
The light (the light), just how far would you go chasing it? (How far)
Seeing this together, the radiance we decided on, has become the gem of my heart (of me)
Ah, surely you... feel the same...!
The seasons are passing by, everything changes (that's right)
It's natural, yet my heart feels slightly (slightly) lonely
Your feelings (your feelings), just how far would you go chasing them? (How far)
We've come so far since when we first met and decided to be together
Ah, surely everyone... feels the same...!
