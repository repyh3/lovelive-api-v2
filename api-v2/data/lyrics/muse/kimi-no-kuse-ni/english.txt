NO! I know you, you know me
I say "We are friends!!"
When we were little kids
You were always the crybaby
But before I knew it, our roles had reversed
It's frustrating, hmph!
When we're alone, I don't know why
But for some reason your face looks so mature at times
Even though it's just you, my heart is swaying!
That's wrong! NO NO NO NO NO!!
Huh? We're just friends
My heart shouldn't be throbbing like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
So there's no way I'd fall in love with you!
I smack your back jokingly
But quickly feel flustered at how broad it is
Where did your brattiness go?
Now I feel lonely, hmph!
It doesn't seem like you have a girlfriend
And I don't think you'll get one
But in spite of that, today you brought a girl with you!
That's mean! NO NO NO NO NO!!
Huh? We're just friends
I shouldn't be feeling jealous like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
But I think I'm in love; what should I do!?
Huh? We're just friends
My heart shouldn't be throbbing like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
So there's no way I'd fall in love with you!
Huh? We're just friends
I shouldn't be feeling jealous like this
Huh? We're childhood friends
But I think I'm in love; what should I do!?
NO! I know you, you know me
I say "We are friends!!"
NO! I know you, you know me
You say? "We are friends!!"
