Why is it, that the piercing wind fills the streets
Why is it, that the sunset is full of pain
The leaves of the autumn-colored trees are my love,
They all seem like they're about to fall
Does my voice reach you?
The sky I asked, foretells a labyrinth of love
Because I love you (Because I love you) And because I love you (And because I love you)
Please hug me
I want to know your true feelings clearly
That's right, the traces of the swimsuit aren't fading
That's right, the sandals aren't being kept away
The summer-colored memories are my love
I want to experience our season once more
Even now, I'm still struck by the disease of wanting to meet you
My passionate heart is in pain, lost in a labyrinth of love
Even if it's impossible (Even if it's impossible) It's not impossible (It's not impossible)
Let's start it all again
I knew it all along, you're my destiny
Does my voice reach you?
Even now I still want to meet you, I want to meet you right now
Because I like you (Because I like you) And because I like you (And because I like you)
Please hug me
I want to know your true feelings clearly
Even if it's impossible (Even if it's impossible) It's not impossible (It's not impossible)
Let's start it all again
I knew it all along, you're my destiny
