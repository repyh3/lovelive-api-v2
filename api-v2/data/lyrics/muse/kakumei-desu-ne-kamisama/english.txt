Everything is from God’s will… it’s a revolution, isn't it? God!
Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Base it off the wishes, Go the world (Hi)
Defend the wishes, Kiss the world (Hi)
(Hi Hi Hi)
The form of happiness is unknown to everyone
The miracle to find everyone’s happiness
It’s tough work
I want to be of help
We are one hundred percent serious!
From the darkness, there is a twinkling bright smile
During the truly painful times, please shout out
“Our strong, strong bonds!”
That kind of God, using dreams to show the way
Will always support us
Probably, in the future, for all eternity, right?
This seems like an era where nothing will be lost
Therefore now is the time, I have to do this
This is not an absolute fate
Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Base it off the wishes, Go the world (Hi)
The course of love for each person is a mystery
The awareness to develop everyone’s love
Challenges are work too
It's not enough to say “I have to help”
We will cheer with all we've got!
If we’re likely to be engulfed by the sinister waves
Firmly seize it and please shout out
“Our strong, strong feelings!”
If I move forward with that kind of God
Surely tomorrow will be
All up to me to make well, right?
In the case where everything is precious
It would be nice if we could close off the vault in the heart
This is not a comforting fate
Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Defend the wishes, Kiss the world (Hi)
“A strong, strong me?”
That kind of God, using dreams to show the way
Will always support us
Probably, in the future, for all eternity, right?
This seems like an era where nothing will be lost
Therefore now is the time, I have to do this
This is not an absolute fate
Grant the wishes, Bless the world (Hi)
Base it off the wishes, Go the world (Hi)
Defend the wishes, Kiss the world (Hi Hi Hi)
