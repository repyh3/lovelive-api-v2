Being able to be earnest is lovely
It's not logic but an earnest feeling
Do you possess rules of freedom and courage?
・Do not fear progress
・Share the joy
Even if it's only those two, I want to uphold them without fail
Oh, Love & Peace
Let my heart become a gentle breeze
Yes, I want to give you energy so you'll do your best
Oh, Love & Peace
When you're sad, I vow
To always hold you tight, don't forget that
Even if it's painful, cry no more
Let's graduate from the solitude, Love & Peace
Becoming too reckless is agonizing
Let's look back and take a deep breath
Everyone loves freedom and courage
・Don't hate yourself
・Don't ridicule purity
Even if it’s embarrassing, I have something I want to say
Oh, You may dream
Let's create a fun story
Because I always want to go with you
Oh, You may dream
You probably won't give up? I'm sure!
Let's smile even when we're in a pinch, we'll make it somehow
Come, the dark night is vexing and restless but
The dawn is near, You may dream
Even if it's just a bit of courage
If you have that, then someday, things will certainly change
For everyone, things start from a little freedom
Aim for the skies, and soon you'll be free
Oh, Love & Peace
Let my heart become a gentle breeze
Yes, I want to give you energy so you'll do your best
Oh, Love & Peace
When you're sad, I vow
To always hold you tight, don't forget that
Even if it's painful, cry no more
Let's graduate from the solitude, Love & Peace
