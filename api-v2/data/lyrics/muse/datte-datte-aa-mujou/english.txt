This moment is precious
Being rushed toward destiny
That moment when we were holding each other was our sign of farewell
I'll be waiting, always waiting
Those drifting words
They do not vanish in the wind; they definitely exist in the warmth of my chest
The day you will go to the ends of the Earth, seeking the things you believe in
Will you stick with this unstoppable way of living
I just pray for you, all alone.
Oh how heartless...
This world is full of sorrow
But even that is fine,
Having met is a joy, isn't that right?
So don't lose
Don't twist your heart
I prepared for farewell with the 'you' that was smiling
Wait for me, always wait for me
Communicating with our eyes,
I'll wait at the place of our memories, until the day you return.
What sort of tomorrow can you see? That's right, a tomorrow of hope
Will you continue with this unstoppable way of living?
I just watch over your direction, all alone.
Oh how heartless...
But the world wishes for happiness
Even so
I want to feel the meaning of our encounter... Oh how heartless!
Oh how heartless...
This world is full of sorrow
But even that is fine,
Having met is a joy, isn't that right?
Oh how heartless...
But the world wishes for happiness
Even so
I want to feel the meaning of our encounter... Oh how heartless!
