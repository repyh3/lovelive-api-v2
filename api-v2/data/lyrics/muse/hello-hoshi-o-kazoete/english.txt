Hello, called by all the music here
This brightly lit town feels just like a carnival
Hello, if we try to answer it
I'm sure our world will expand bit by bit, hello!
Shall we join in the dancing at the intersection?
Everything feels so free here
It feels like we'll be swallowed
By an oncoming wave of people
We don't know the words to this melody
But it seemingly starts filling up with strength
Hello, if we count the stars
And start to divine what we will come across in the future
Hello, will it be impossible to foretell?!
But I'm sure if we're together, we can enjoy anything, hello!
What will happen when we wake up tomorrow? What should we do?
Filled with excitement, I feel something's about to start
Everything feels so radiant
So we stretch out our hands high
I wonder what this excitement is
Our own lively rhythm
Out tempo is set. It feels like we can fly into the starlit sky
A brand new melody,
we don't know the words to this melody
But it seemingly starts filling up with strength
Hello, it's a message from the stars
Let's touch upon our dreams while we're full of energy
Hello, this warmth is eternal
I'm sure if we're together we can enjoy anything, hello!
I love new world!
Ah, this is a new world
This feeling of always wanting to try new things
It will never disappear
It will always bring us happiness? (That’s right)
The stars, (they shine) the stars (they glitter) are so pretty
See, they fill us up with strength
Everyone, come now! Hello, it's a message... from the stars
Let's touch upon our dream as we're full of energy
Hello, this warmth is eternal
But I'm sure everything will be fun if we're together
Hello, if we count the stars
And start to divine what we will come across in the future
Hello, will it be impossible to foretell?!
But I'm sure if we're together, we can enjoy anything, hello!
What will happen when we wake up tomorrow? What should we do?
