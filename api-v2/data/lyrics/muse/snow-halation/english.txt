This feeling, it's strange, isn't it?
It's almost as though it came fluttering down from the sky
The color of this special season fills me with excitement
From the moment we met,
The melody of my heart has been ringing with premonitions
It can’t be stopped, it won’t be stopped -- why?
Ring out
Shall I name this heart-rending pain "Snow halation"?
I can’t wait for our feelings to resonate; it’s frustrating, but it’s a pure-hearted devotion called love
Even in this mild fever, I can’t hesitate
I'll accept the courage to dive in; it's about to start!
Without a sound, nor a sign
Our fate changes silently
At the thought of the coming future, my heartbeat quickens
When you feel troubled
I’ll come running right away, wanting to hug you tightly,
Wherever you are, no matter where, I'll Fly high!
Hurry up
Before I knew it, my true emotions grew too large to contain
It's painful to never do more than dream of it
I want you to be mine!
I don't want to be bewildered by your gentle eyes
Accept all my love for you as it is, Please!
Ring out
Shall I name this heart-rending pain "Snow halation"?
I can’t wait for our feelings to resonate; It’s frustrating, but it’s a pure-hearted devotion called love
Even in this mild fever, I can’t hesitate
I'll accept the courage to dive in; it's about to start!
