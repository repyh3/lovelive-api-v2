The wind is calling; the trees are rustling
Sakura colors dance in this season
My memories are fluttering once again; ah, they have descended
Do you remember the day of our encounter
Lately it's been burning stronger
This feeling of uneasiness from the start has continued till now
Let's make a promise
Even if we become separated someday
Let's meet here once again
And watch the beautiful flowers bloom
One day in the rain,One day in the shine
These flowing thoughts don't disappear
In the same place, we could see tomorrow
One day in the rain,One day in the shine
I hold on to these overflowing feelings
The path we were following, led to our unfolding dream
In the shaking distance, the flaming greenery
While drawing summer's pulsating rainbow
The echoing voice was throbbing; ah, how exciting
Being together forever, isn't that nice
Whispering that is embarrassing
This neverending fun, I want to continue believing in it
Let's make a wish
For a future even the stars in the sky do not know
We'll definitely check here for each other
The strength of our unchanging bond
Someday of my life,Someday of my love
Let's laugh without sadness
Let's put in what's left and smile again tomorrow
Someday of my life,Someday of my love
A lot of my feelings are welling up
The hope that was given to us, gave us our unfolding dream
One day in the rain,One day in the shine
These flowing thoughts don't disappear
In the same place, we could see tomorrow
Someday of my life,Someday of my love
Let's laugh without sadness
Let's put in what's left and smile again tomorrow
Someday of my life,Someday of my love
A lot of my feelings are welling up
The hope that was given to us, gave us our unfolding dream
