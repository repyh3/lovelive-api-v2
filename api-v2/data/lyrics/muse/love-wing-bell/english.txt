The time has come to welcome the moment we’ve been waiting for
Is it okay for me to be feeling so much happiness?
This road we walk down, beckoned by the light,
Continues on to the future, brimming up with hope
Can anyone become cute? Yes, I know that it’s possible
Even someone like me… Can transform
So, I’ll give this to you. Cheer up! With our smiles as they are
Let’s sing, let’s sing! I’ll give this to you, cheer up
Let’s stop worrying and look to our dreams
If I’m with all of my friends, new things are within my reach
Let’s be reborn. From here, your world will grow even more
Come on, I can see tomorrow ahead
Love wing… love wing…
I’m casting my hesitation off, let’s straighten our backs and stand tall
Oh, that’s nice. Now then, let’s just enjoy the wonders here
The self that I never knew was bathed in bright light
Even if it’s just for today, I want to be as brilliant as I can be
Let’s all become cute! It’s definitely possible
Just look, even I can… Transform!
Yes, that’s right, every girl will have a chance to be a princess
So happy, so happy, it’s just like magic
Surprise brings forth the pulse of a dream
Love is an important thing. It lets you do some wonderful things
Let’s be reborn and look for the next stage
Now, what kind of ‘me’ shall I be tomorrow?
Love bell… love bell…
I’ll give this to you. Cheer up! With our smiles as they are
Let’s sing, let’s sing! I’ll give this to you, cheer up
Let’s stop worrying and look to our dreams
Love is an important thing. It lets you do some wonderful things
Let’s be reborn and look for the next stage
Now, what kind of ‘me’ shall I be tomorrow?
Love wing… love bell…
