I definitely want to capture new dreams even more than I do now
If I boldly jump out, my life will be O.K.
My hopes are huge
Growing high and far
Let's go embrace a dazzling tomorrow
Let's make all of our dreams come true
That's right! Just by believing
You'll move forward steadily, yes, you will!
You don't have to give an answer since I understand
The place drawn in our hearts is the same
Never giving up, searching for it will be our challenge
Our energetic temperatures won't go down
We feverishly flap our wings
When you talk about your aspirations,
I love the unyielding expression in your eyes… I love it!
Even when you cry, the sky will stay blue, the color never-changing
I want to see you right away, O.K. sunshine
I want to feel what it's like to line up with you
I don't need a reason if I'm next to you
I'll tell you right away
Why our feelings are getting so close
That's right! Everyone has a single
Fragment of courage that they carry, even you!
We'll be together forever
It's a great plan so let's chase after it
And search for a place that makes our hearts dance
We'll stumble, get back up and be able to gaze at each other on our joyous adventure
I wonder how far our smiles will reach
I don't need things like promises but,
I want to be with you no matter what
Rushing by together, we shine… We shine!
You don't have to give an answer since I understand
The place drawn in our hearts is the same
Never giving up, searching for it will be our challenge
Our energetic temperatures won’t go down
We feverishly flap our wings
When you talk about your aspirations,
I love the unyielding expression in your eyes… I love it!
