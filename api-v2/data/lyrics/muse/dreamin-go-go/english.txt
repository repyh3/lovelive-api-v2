The area of the dream we were searching for
You, too, were laughing while running towards it
Shall I wipe your sweat off for you?
Even while holding back, I threw you a towel
It's a feeling that we can go anywhere
Luggage and schedules, all those are unneeded
No matter who Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Let's try flying off into the distance
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Don't tell me that it's impossible
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) In any case, just aim straight ahead
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) I want to meet more exciting things
Dreamin' never disappearing
Dreamin' Sensation
There's no spare time to be discouraged
What's important is that you don't stop
Over the hills and over the mountains
Say goodbye to the puny self you were
No matter when, always show your seriousness
And the parts of your personality no one knows
Unyielding Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Wanting to seize the future
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) The momentum allows us to keep advancing
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) And if we were to ever meet sadness
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Even that is just the spice of life
Smiling If it's you
Smiling You would understand, right?
Unyielding Go! Go! Wanting to seize the future
Go! Go! The momentum allows us to keep advancing
No matter who Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Let's try flying off into the distance
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) Don't tell me that it's impossible
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) In any case, just aim straight ahead
Go!(Go!) Go!(Go!) I want to meet more exciting things
Dreamin' never disappearing
Dreamin' Sensation
