Is it starting...?
Nobody, nobody, is aware
For the sake of this love to be born again
I have now become a quivering butterfly
The flowers' fragrance is frightening, intoxicatingly sweet
My heart melts... I can't explain it
Wait, don't discover me this quickly
It's strange (It's strange) It's strange (It's strange) A strangely hot sigh
Can be a little bit passionate
Fluttering about in a dream, the romantic within me
Is feeling lost upon its first awakening
Somehow it isn't bad
Fluttering about in a dream, it's all embarrassing
But that's no good
Come on, you have no choice but to try and fly
I want to watch this fluttering dream, this heart pounding dream
How about a fragile, fragile love
The flower buds are enticing me
But I still can't move my weak wings
Being merry and trying a sip of the nectar, I thought
The cherry blossom's trap... I can't resist it
Wait, haven't I met you somewhere before?
It's weird (It's weird) It's weird (It's weird) that disagreements are bitter
Yet unexpectedly passionate
Feeling it makes my heart throb, I've finally become a romantic
The excitement of having a crush for the first time
Isn't bad in the slightest
Feeling it makes my heart throb, the butterflies disturbing my heart
Please don't hurt them
Ah, when I tried to fly, what would become of me?
When I fell in love...
Softly holding me
This dream is feeling Romantic
The season of beginning (The season of beginning)
Is a little bit passionate, unexpectedly passionate
Fluttering about in a dream, the romantic within me
Is feeling lost upon its first awakening
Somehow it isn't bad
Fluttering about in a dream, it's all embarrassing
But that's no good
Come... once you fall in love, you have no choice but to try and fly
I want to watch this fluttering dream, this heart pounding dream
