ENDLESS PARADE The magic of these lights
I want it to reach, all the way to you
ENDLESS PARADE Fun dreams are
Never ending, that's our slogan
I say "Together"
You say "Let's fly!"
Aah, if we just dance more and more intensely
Today we don't want to return home, let's play!
Let's forget about the time, with no end in sight
The happy music is resonating
dance dance because
dance dance I love you!
Our PARADE
Endless Message The rising beat
Can't be stopped, with our happiness
Endless Message With our fun dreams
Let's form a connection, that's also our slogan
I say "Together"
You say "We're flying!"
Aah, forever and ever, let's dance just like now
Today we want to laugh, surely it's the same tomorrow
With our shining hearts, let's head for the future
The happy music is playing
dance dance because
dance dance No matter who!
Us and the PARADE
Today we don't want to return home, let's play!
Let's forget about the time, with no end in sight
The happy music is resonating
dance dance because
dance dance I love you!
Our PARADE
