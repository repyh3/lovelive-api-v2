Boredom… There’s no time to feel it
Hold down the mystery and show me
From such whispers, it falls
An innocent heart, ah how lovely
And it is stained by uncertainty
The people with broken-like wings
Love, dreams and the like are loved, throw them away already
(Boredom… One day)
It would be nice if you became strong in front of me (become strong)
Even while you’re getting hurt, crawl back up (shivering)
From that momentary pleasure, I approach eternity
Now, at the unknown words, I make an overflowing oath
Run past uncertainty
You can betray the spirit of imprisonment
Even if you shout, even if you turn around, it’s just your own shadow
Even so, run past the darkness
Stroke the betrayed sincerity
I think I can still make it in time
Now, let’s go and oppose it
For the sake of not getting fooled anymore
The people who spread their wings
Love, the beloved illusions, erase them right now
(Boredom… One day)
I will probably remain in depression (become depressed)
I wait for the moment while being ridiculed (I’m running out of patience)
As for the gentleman-like pact, it has nothing to do with ladies
Now, at the truthful words, I smash that fake smile
Destiny will change
A repainted new world
Blooms from the lovely splendor, I want to see it for myself
Destiny will change proudly
If you fall like a flower, you will be red
Just being fired up is not bad too
Now, let’s have some fun
Boredom… "Come towards the sleep to end it all" it invites me
That is surely fine when it's calm, right?
Day after day until it becomes so
Run past uncertainty
You can betray the spirit of imprisonment
Even if you shout, even if you turn around, it’s just your own shadow
Even so, run past the darkness
Stroke the betrayed sincerity
I think I can still make it in time
Now, let’s go and oppose it
Now, let’s go and oppose it
