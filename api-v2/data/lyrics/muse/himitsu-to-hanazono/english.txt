Don’t talk about the unreachable dreams
Is this the act of the beauty that seems to disappear?
I start wanting to feel the freezing lights
It’s strange that the heart is covered in mystery, isn't it?
In the unknown world, if I were to see and meet you
I begin wanting to convey it to you
I hurt someone
To not care is to not be sorry
Ah… the desire to violently run past
As it is, no matter the place, we will both go fall together
Is this time a sin?
Just lock up these unreachable feelings
Sadness gives me a reward
Although the overlapping worlds distort
It’d be nice if the two of us could take it in
Demolish the future
To not be afraid is to not grieve
Ah… There’s no need for tender hopes and the like
Being torn off by those eyes, we will both go fall together
This prayer is any and all sin
In the unknown world, I see you and meet you too
The present and unchanging sorrow
In that case, although the worlds already distort
It’d be nice if the two of us could take it in
I hurt someone
To not care is to not be sorry
Ah… the desire to violently run past
As it is, no matter the place, we will both go fall together
If this time is a sin
This prayer is also a sin, right?
