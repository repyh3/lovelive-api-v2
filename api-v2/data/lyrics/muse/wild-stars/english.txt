Hide→ Open→ Hide, This isn’t love yet
Open→ Hide→ Open, Prepare yourself and chase after it
I want to start…WILD STARS
With a whimsical light I’ll find you
Let yourself be swept away by the stimulation on a night like this
Suffering from boredom, It sways my chest
The sudden storm was a passionate, wild wind
I searched forever and ever for a place to meet you
You and I came here
From now on the two of us, From now on we’ll shine
Hide→ Open→ Hide, This isn’t love yet
Open→ Hide→ Open, Prepare yourself and chase after it
I want to start…WILD STARS
Break free of the constellations, I want to dance with you
Show that gentle face only to me
Fire grows in my eyes, I can’t yield to anyone
The shock I sensed made me feel quite reckless
I want to see you I wish, surely, surely it’ll get through
And then you and I came
Right now the two of us, Right now we shine
Move→ Open→ Move, Come, this is turning into love
Open→ Move→ Open, We stand before the gates of love
If I whispered that…WILD LOVE
I want to distance myself from the lonely skies
I know I can do it if I’m with you
The darkness will vanish, Beyond the darkness
There’s a dazzling place, it’s there, it’s there, I can see it
Move→ Open→ Move, Come, this is turning into love
Open→ Move→ Open, We stand before the gates of love
If I whispered that what would you do? WILD STARS
