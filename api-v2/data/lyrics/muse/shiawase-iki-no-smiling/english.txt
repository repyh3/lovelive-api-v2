SMILING! My worries, Bye-bye SMILING!
SMILING! My worries, Bye-bye SMILING!
With a pat, the bright morning is pinching my cheeks
I slept tons, it's time to say goodbye to my bed
Everything that happened yesterday is hazy
But for now, I'll just smile like myself
With this momentum, I can change anything
If your heart thinks "I can do it!", then it'll be fine
So, hold my hand
I'll share my energy with you!
Happiness (Happy!)
I know the trick to grasping it (I wanna happy!)
Happy (Happy!)
Always be happy... SMILING! (Lots of SMILING!)
Come, that's why you have to give it your all too (Come on, more!)
And Power Power on! Laughing every day!
SMILING!　Happiness, Welcome　SMILING!
SMILING!　Happiness, Welcome　SMILING!
I was always told that my dreams could come true
It doesn't matter even if it's bit by bit
At any rate, let's advance!
Let's get through our troubles with our smiles
And leap towards our future together
It's okay to say "I love you!" from your heart
Let's link our arms together
It'll double our courage!
Joy (Lucky!)
A premonition of joy is dancing in my chest (I makin' Lucky!)
Joy (Lucky!)
Don't let it escape... CATCHING! (Lots of CATCHING!)
Yes, you have to enjoy this more too (Yes, more!)
LOVE Power Power on! Let's laugh at the wonders!
If your heart thinks "I can do it!", then it'll be fine
So, hold my hand
I'll share my energy with you!
Happiness (Happy!)
I know the trick to grasping it (I wanna happy!)
Happy (Happy!)
Always be happy... SMILING! (Lots of SMILING!)
Come, that's why you have to give it your all too (Come on, more!)
And Power Power on! Laughing every day!
