A fanfare played in my heart when we met
You'll never lose your passion
That's what I believe
Instead of sitting comfortably, I want to go on adventures
Smiles on our faces, jumping high
Our time never pauses
We'll continue to seek our radiance
Do your best, do your best! Wonderful things
Lie in store for you right ahead
I'm OK, I'm OK!　I'm not giving up!
We'll be happiness makers tomorrow too!
Do your best, do your best! Give it a try
And something wonderful will happen
I'm OK, I'm OK!　I wanna shout it out!
"Let's go! Together, always!"
The music I play is overflowing with my wishes
Let's talk about them, one by one, and then move on
Towards a new future
Off toward new discoveries, off on a trip
Our hopes burn on, it's a brand new day
Let's stand in new, fun places
The forecast for excitement is as strong as ever
It's all okay, it's all okay! Let's have fun
Our energy makes us invincible
Let's smile, let's smile! We won't lose heart
We'll be happiness makers every day!
It's all okay, it's all okay! Have fun
Our energy makes us invincible
Let's smile, let's smile! Can you hear us?
"Dance! I love everyone!"
Instead of sitting comfortably, I want to go on adventures
