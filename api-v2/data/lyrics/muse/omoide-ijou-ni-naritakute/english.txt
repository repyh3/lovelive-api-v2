The morning sun is dazzling, if you climb up this hill
The leaves of the gingko tree waver on the way to school
Your back (If I find it)
Overtake you and use the chance (I'll)
To always say good morning
Even though I couldn't confess, I loved you
Even though we were on the same street as back then
Walking by myself, searching for someone who isn't there
Embarrassed of my own feelings
I want to meet you, so my heart is calling out
Because if you were to be just a memory, I can't stand that
Somehow everyday, even if it was just a single word
Our conversations were so nostalgic
Recently (I'd like to know)
How are you spending your days? (After all)
I heard you have a lover... It's a lie, right?
I can't give up, not with those kind eyes
I dream of those times and cry as I wake
That's why my feelings now, I have no choice but to convey them
For the sake of this love which will change the future
I want to meet you, so my heart is calling out
I want to try making more memories with the two of us
Walking by myself, searching for someone who isn't there
Embarrassed of my own feelings
I want to meet you, so my heart is calling out
I've decided to muster my courage
Aa, letting it be only a memory
Is something I can't stand
