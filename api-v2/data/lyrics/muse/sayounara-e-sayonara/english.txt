Was the sky this same color, when it all began?
Since then I've looked up at it time and again, comparing the differences
While wandering aimless, wondering whether there was something I could do, I ended up here
And thanks to you, I really could do it -- I'm grateful we met
Sharing our happiness, and frustration too, gives us the power to head towards tomorrow
Since I came running all this way, I have no regrets at all
Rather than wallow in nostalgia
Let's give each other a smile and say, 'we'll meet again!'
We'll set 'farewell' aside, until 'maybe someday' comes
I want to cherish this joy, and have fun together with everyone
'Let's bid farewell farewell!'
A silly urge, but I found myself wanting to say it...
You're in my heart; that won't ever change
I wonder what it is that'll change, then? The passage of time, and our wishes?
At the familiar road's end, the season's light shimmers
And I can already see them in your eyes -- your plans for what's ahead
Leaving all sadness behind, my chest swells with love
I'll always keep running after you; just promise we'll be together, that's all I need
Those words have been repeated so many times, I won't say them
It's painful to, so I won't say them
'Farewell' means 'we'll meet again someday' -- we'll make it mean that
All of us wanting to cherish this joy and have fun together, let's say it together:
'Farewell to farewell!' It's a daring 'Hello!' for the future
Those words have been repeated so many times, I won't say them
It's painful to, so I won't say them
'Farewell' means 'we'll meet again someday' -- we'll make it mean that
Rather than wallow in nostalgia
Let's give each other a smile and say, 'we'll meet again!'
We'll set 'farewell' aside, until 'maybe someday' comes
I want to cherish this joy, and have fun together with everyone
'Farewell to farewell!'
A silly urge, but I found myself wanting to say it...
It might be a good thing to say, after all!
