Hi hi hi! Try and smile
Hi hi hi! Being able to smile is important
Instead of worrying or rushing, let's take life easy
A smile-filled everyday
I want you to feel great,
So raise both hands with an oomph!
Take a deep breath, okay? Higher, higher
Isn't it simple? Yeah!
Sending you magic, the magic of a smile
To make everyone happy
A smiley magic, the magic of a smile
Say good-bye to all your tears
Here's a nico-nico smile!
C'mon, have fun!
Look here, look here
"Have fun, feel better, better!"
Look here, look here
"Have fun, feel better"
Let's laugh!
The weather's perfect, I'm getting excited
I want to run, even faster!
Chase after me, don't take your time!　Hurry, hurry
Isn't it simple? Yeah!
The next spell, a smile's spell
So we'll all be happy together
A smiley spell, a smile's spell
Today and tomorrow, too
Here's a nico-nico smile!
See, aren't you happy now? (bang!)
(Do your best!)
Sending you magic, the magic of a smile
To make everyone happy
A smiley magic, the magic of a smile
Say good-bye to all your tears
Here's a nico-nico smile!
C'mon, have fun!
The magic of a smile, the next magic
Sending you magic, to make everyone happy
The magic of a smile, the next magic
Sending you magic, to make everyone happy
