I want to gaze at you every day
I want to gaze at you from morning to night
When I feel your gentleness even through your nonchalant act
I get the feeling that the two of us can become happy
When I'm with you (I want to be) our hearts (with you)
Draw closer to each other, don't they?
And forever (the two of us)
We will chase our dreams together
I'm always counting every wonderful moment we share
I feel like the loving heartbeats you give are protecting me
I want to tell you that
So I tug on your hand a bit
It's through your nonchalant act that your gentleness shines
And I know without a doubt that the two of us can become happy
I believe...
When this overflowing fondness started to feel like second nature
I made up my mind, I'll definitely become happy, with you...
If I say aloud (I want you) that I want to be with you (to be with me)
We'll both know for certain then, right?
And forever (the two of us)
We will coat our dreams with a new shine, and chase after them
I'm always playing our shared memories over in my mind
This bond of love ties me to you so that I'll never let go
I wanted to tell you that, so
Hey, come a bit closer to me
I'm always counting every wonderful moment we share
I feel like the loving heartbeats you give are protecting me
And when I go to tell you that
My tears spill out, a little bit...
I'm always playing our shared memories over in my mind
This bond of love ties me to you so that I'll never let go
I wanted to tell you that, so
Hey, come a bit closer to me
With this overflowing fondness feeling like second nature
I know without a doubt that the two of us will become happy
I believe...
