Hey, could I tell you something?
about myself...
My heart is aflutter because I might be able to see you today
I want to skip down the path
And dance in this moment
You probably never pay any attention to me
But... I'm here
I'm right here
My confidence is wavering... What if you don't like me?
Anyway, I need to greet you energetically!
The sun's finally out in full strength
I can feel my energy rising
Instead of saying "Good morning," I tap you on the back
And say "Come on, let's go!"
If the sun's finally out in full strength
I'll surely be smiling happily
But for some reason, my heart is hurting now
I space out during class and stare far, far away
Isn't love supposed to be sweet?
That's not right; it's half bitter
Instead of just dreaming, I want to feel it for myself to make sure
That's why... I'll make my move
Sounds like what I'd do, right?
I love my life; every day is like a miracle
So it goes without saying that I'll be courageous instead of regretting!
I've always, always been waiting to hear it from you
But now I'll say it first:
"I love you!"
I've always, always been waiting
So won't you answer me?
Show me your complete feelings
I love my life; every day is like a miracle
I'm actually scared on the inside, but I'll be brave!
I've always, always been waiting to hear it from you
But now I'll say it first:
"I love you!"
I've always, always been waiting
So won't you answer me?
Show me your complete feelings
