"Is there something you want to forget?"
The message I sent to your heart, do receive it
Close your eyes, you're invited to a world of dreams
Let's ride the gondola of the stars to a dazzling world
How would you like it? That's what I want to ask
How would you like it? Tell me more
That lonely face of yours, let's turn it into a smile together
Let's begin! Just us two, our
love is a MUSEUM
Filled with happiness, the paintings of hugs are waiting
Would snuggling be okay?
Would holding hands be okay?
Aah, I'm embarrassed and shy, sorry!
"Aren't there times when being alone is boring?"
You sent me a message too right, I received it
It contained lots of things, but the last was everyone's smiles
Such a scene would be great, let's head to this wonderful blooming world
How would I like it? I want to try saying it
How would I like it? Well, that's simple
I want it fun, with smiles that will never fade
Let it never end! Us two, our magical
love MUSEUM
I've always liked you, my passionate thoughts are overflowing with color
Staring at you makes my heart pound
Wanting to touch you makes my heart pound
Aah, this dreamlike scene makes me shy, sorry!
How would you like it? That's what I want to ask
How would I like it? Well, that's simple
I want us to meet in a dazzling world, in a wonderful world
Let's begin! Just us two, our
love is a MUSEUM
Filled with happiness, the paintings of hugs are waiting
Would snuggling be okay?
Would holding hands be okay?
Aah, I'm embarrassed and shy, sorry!
My heart is pounding uncontrollably, sorry!
