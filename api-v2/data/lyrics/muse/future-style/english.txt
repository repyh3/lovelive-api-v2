I wanted you to listen to me, that's what I've always thought
Anyway, if we just try to start moving
The future will be born bit by bit within each new day
We still want to challenge ourselves, we can do it
Let's all chase those sparkling days together
Future style
I want to meet you, so please wait for that moment
Someday upon that stage we hoped for
That exists only here within this world
Future style
I want to meet you, so please wait for that moment
Now is the time I want to grant all our wishes; I wish starting
It's time for our greatest dreams to take shape
Your voice... I can hear it!
Just a little bit of courage can be the trigger
What's really inside you is courage that makes you want to fly high
If you let it out, you'll be able to see a larger stage next time
After all, I definitely want to tell you
Let's put in all our might together and enjoy ourselves
Shiny style
We did our best and jumped, covered in sweat
It's a stage forever bursting with smiles
The world's most wonderful stage
Shiny style
We did our best and jumped, covered in sweat
Beside, in front and even behind us; We love music
Because our greatest dreams seem to be taking shape
Come on everyone... Future party!
Our hearts are one, everyone's dancing while dreaming of the same miracle
This is the Love Live we dreamed of!
Let's go!!
I want to meet you, so please wait for that moment
Someday upon that stage we hoped for
That exists only here within this world
Future style
I want to meet you, so please wait for that moment
Now is the time I want to grant all our wishes; I wish starting
It's time for our greatest dreams to take shape
Your voice... I can hear it!
