To be shaken by the winds of time is my destiny
But even so, for love; I will fight for love
It's not the end just yet (I don't want to give up)
Ah, it was forbidden (My feelings are growing)
I can't find any salvation, even though I pray
Just staring at each other (Forget about everything)
Time was what I wanted (Words are unneeded)
Run away? That's not allowed! Each of our wishes remain ungranted
In the next world (I want to meet you again)
After being born again (I want to meet you again)
Let's vow to find happiness this time round (Let's vow)
Come on, through that door (I'm sending you off)
Come on, after you leave (You'll depart)
Don't turn back, alright (Disappear immediately... please!)
We won't meet again
Within dreams, our souls (Inside our dreams) are drawn to one another (For the sake of love)
No matter where our bodies are, you can hear my voice, right?
Within dreams, our souls (Inside our dreams) are drawn to one another, so (For the sake of love)
It's not something sorrowful, right? Because we're always together
Just staring at each other (Forget about everything)
Time was what I wanted (Words are unneeded)
Run away? That's not allowed!
Each of our wishes remain ungranted, no matter how much I pray
That day, it seemed like I fell in love at first sight
It feels like it was just yesterday
That day, when I believed that someday the two of us would definitely be tied together...
The next world is (Because we'll meet again)
A peaceful world (Because we'll meet again)
Let's vow to definitely find happiness (Let's vow)
Come on, through that door (I'm sending you off) Come on, after you leave (You'll depart)
It'll be bad to call after you (Disappear immediately... please!)
Even if my tears are overflowing
Holding on to illusions (Holding on to dreams) We continue living on (Holding on softly)
After quietly keeping these memories warm in our eternal love
Holding on to illusions (Holding on to dreams) We continue living on (Holding on softly)
Even the faint warmth of your kiss is good enough
To be shaken by the winds of time is my destiny
But even so, for love; I will fight for love
(Let time stop right now... Please!)
A flame of revolution...
Within dreams, our souls (Inside our dreams) are drawn to one another (For the sake of love)
No matter where our bodies are, you can hear my voice, right?
Within dreams, our souls (Inside our dreams) are drawn to one another, so (For the sake of love)
It's not something sorrowful, right? Because we're always together
Just staring at each other (Forget about everything)
Time was what I wanted (Words are unneeded)
Run away? That's not allowed!
Each of our wishes remain ungranted, no matter how much I pray
