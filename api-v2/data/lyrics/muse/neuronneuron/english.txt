Rather than knowing nothing and growing timid
Take arms against the unknown things ~neuron
The law of this world has started to change
Within this large and mighty power
We’re almost there, take that one step forward
Save me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
Correct everything (You can do it ~neuron!)
Save me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
So come, now’s the time (You can do it ~neuron!)
Pass through all the painful things with all you've got
Start running ~neuron, look here, yes yes yes!
In order to be connected, these separated futures
I want to connect them right here ~neuron
A dream to bring change, the world is still stirring
I will change the grief of the frail
While saving them, if you embrace them tightly, they will jump out
Help me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
Towards the unknown world (You can go to it ~neuron)
Help me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
Now’s the time, come, now’s the time (You can go to it ~neuron)
Even when you lose, clearly and firmly move forward
Everyone is watching, look here, yes yes yes!
We’re almost there, take that one step forward
Save me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
Correct everything (You can do it ~neuron!)
Save me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
So come, now’s the time (You can do it ~neuron!)
Help me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
Towards the unknown world (You can go to it ~neuron)
Help me ~neuron, I say! NEURON, NEURON!!
Now’s the time, come, now’s the time (You can go to it ~neuron)
