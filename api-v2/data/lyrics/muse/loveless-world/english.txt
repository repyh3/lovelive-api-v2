Look at me...No, don't look...
My heart is crying out as my memories are torn apart
By a fate that won't let us be together
Look at me...No, don't look...
Both of those options are me
I'll give you a farewell kiss before leaving for a land of sorrow
LOVELESS WORLD
I didn't want to know
About that kindness and warmth
Because I'm returning to a world of eternal darkness
That was the first time I'd been loved by someone
The more I was loved, the more painful it was, and I cried
The forbidden flame of love
Look at me...No, don't look...
My heart is crying out as my memories are torn apart
By a fate that won't let us be together
Look at me...No, don't look...
Both of those options are me
I'll give you a farewell kiss before leaving for a land of sorrow
LOVELESS WORLD
Living the same moments
Sharing the same dreams
So long as my wish won't be granted, I'll have to return to isolation
I smile as I say those cold words
But even if I act distant, it hurts
The flame of love can't be extinguished
Forget...No, don't forget...
I embrace you
I really do want to choose a future of destruction
Forget...No, don't forget... both of those options are me
I head for the darkness as I pray for happiness
LOVELESS WORLD
This flame won't go out
It still burns within me
I want to embrace you here
I want to forget everything
Forget...No, don't forget...
I embrace you
I really do want to choose a future of destruction
Forget...No, don't forget... both of those options are me
I head for the darkness as I pray for happiness
LOVELESS WORLD
Look at me...No, don't look...
My heart is crying out as my memories are torn apart
By a fate that won't let us be together
Look at me...No, don't look...
Both of those options are me
I'll give you a farewell kiss and pray for happiness (I love you)
Before leaving for a land of sorrow, alone (I love you)
LOVELESS WORLD
