Good morning Powerful day! (Morning!)
Let's go! (Let's go!) Today too, today will be fun too~!
Let's go! (Let's go!) WAO-WAO WAO-WAO Fun~! Yeah!
Once your eyes snap awake properly, look up and take a deep breath
Come on, try deciding what shall we begin today
A single day is short, so us being greedy,
We want to try all sorts of things!
It's not enough, it's not enough, more (So!)
Time is what I want (More!)
Things like studying
After all (Yes!) We're busy
(Powerful) What I want
(Miracle) is two or three bodies
(That's right) So, it's a race, Go!
(With all your might) Go!
The things you carelessly left behind, just laugh them off
Yaa, even if things don't fit... Don't mind it!
Even if a year seems long, it'll be gone before you realise it
Hurry on, dance on, fly on!
I want to know, I want to know more (So!)
I thought I could do it (More!)
The chances of success are slim!
Why (Yes!) even though I knew that
(Wonderful) But but I want to see it
(Magical) I want to experience it
(Because of that) Hesitating anymore is a No!
(Regrets are) No!
It's not enough, it's not enough, more (So!)
Time is what I want (More!)
Things like studying
After all (Yes!) We're busy
(Powerful) What I want
(Miracle) is two or three bodies
(That's right) So, it's a race, Go!
(With all your might) Go!
Let's go! (Let's go!) Today too, today will be fun too~!
Let's go! (Let's go!) WAO-WAO WAO-WAO Fun~! Yeah!
Good morning!!
