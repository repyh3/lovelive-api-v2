Stop being so nice to me
It's a lie, all of it is a lie
Just because you're so kind to me
I'm falling more and more in love with you
I'm always by your side
But... we're only friends?
My heart feels like it's being torn apart when I keep hiding my feelings
It's cruel of you to play around with me so carelessly
My heart throbs each time; how long will it take for you to notice?
It's painful to watch you while holding in feelings I desperately want to confess
I won't be able to take it much longer
They'll overflow and the words "I love you" will spill from my lips
Stop being so nice to me
It's a lie, all of it is a lie
Just because you're so kind to me
I'm falling more and more in love with you
I'm always by your side
But... we're only friends?
My heart feels like it's being torn apart when I keep hiding my feelings
When you whisper softly into my ear
I feel myself burning up; why am I so naive?
To be honest, it's painful to look at you every day
I can't move on like this
So I decided to forget about you, but I still want to ascertain my love
It's fine to be mean to me
Never mind, I can't take it after all
When you treat me coldly
I end up wanting to cry
My emotions will overflow and the words "I love you" will spill from my lips
It's fine to be mean to me
Never mind, I can't take it after all
When you treat me coldly
I end up wanting to cry
Stop being so nice to me... That's a lie; I want you to be nice to me
If I keep hiding my feelings, we'll be friends forever, right?
