Bit by bit, my heart Bit by bit, grows hot
I'll show you, I can make all my dreams come true!
Bit by bit, I push ahead Bit by bit, bursting forth
Look straight to the future!
(Hi hi, Move forward! There’s still more to go, Let’s go! Hi hi, Move forward! Come on, come on, Let’s go!!)
What was the most important thing?
A small effort will bring forth tomorrow
Let's strike while loving the moment!
With that sort of energy, let's do our best!
(We always do our best!)
I want us to talk alone more
How far shall we run together?
(To the very end) That's fine by me (There are no limits, alright?)
After this Wonderful Rush
In order to obtain happiness
All of us will set out on a search for a new world
At times I waver, Wonderful Rush, I will believe in that shine
Even if that rainbow is far off... I'll definitely catch it! (Hi!!)
Bit by bit, my heart Bit by bit, grows hot
I'll show you I can make all my dreams come true!
Bit by bit, I push ahead Bit by bit, it bursts forth
(Hi hi, Move forward! There’s still more to go, Let’s go! Hi hi, Moving forward!)
Take hold of the future!
With feelings about life going up and down, fate sometimes changes rapidly
It’s the worst↓ The best↑ The greatest↑ The newest↑
Let's go! Take a Super Jump into the distance!!
I wonder why? It's strange
Our time together having fun
Feels like an instant, and like an eternity
Let’s take off together! Dan-da-Dan-Dan!
It’s important (What is?) A little bit of effort (So it was that!)
I like the present (Is it love?) We’ll collide (So that’s it!)
Energetically (Boldly?) We’ll give it our all (So it was that!)
With all our energy (Boldly?) We’ll give it our all!
I want us to understand each other's feelings more
I want you to always stay by my side
(Because you’re here) Being together is the best (No need for worries, All right?)
For the first time on this Wonderful Stage
We will all stand at our next destination
The season that's brought us together brings a fresh view
My heart comes to life on this Wonderful Stage
My aim is that beautiful rainbow in the distance, so... It's time to depart now!
Wonderful...
Wow! What should I do?
Dreams Come True
Of course Let’s go! Three, two, one, ZERO!!
Hi hi, Super jump! Oh yeah, Super jump!!
Life is wonder, There’s still more to go Let’s go!!
Hi hi, Super jump! Oh yeah, Super jump!!
Life is wonder Wonderful Rush
I want us to talk alone more
How far shall we run together?
(To the very end) That's fine by me (Limits, what are those? No thank you, OK!)
Oh yeah (No need for worries, All right?)
