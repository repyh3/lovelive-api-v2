The rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance
In a hurry
Looking back at myself
I do not look back at what I have caught
I want to be chased
But I won't say it; But I can't say it
So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around
Let's dance and come around, come around
I want fresh experiences no matter what they may be
What we need is probably a feverish love
You don't know? Who is going to come?
Waiting like fruits to be harvested
From a hard, yellow color → it grows pink
I'm trembling shaking
If you reach it now... Yes!
The rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance
In a hurry
Looking back at myself
I do not look back at what I have caught
I want to be chased
But I won't say it; But I can't say it
So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around
Let's dance and come around, come around
I don't want to forget every new day
I hope if you can keep this secret kiss
Is it too early? Is it good even if only a little?
Fruits are thorny so be careful
Turning blue with a sweet scent → Transformed and ready to be eaten
I try to touch it gently
You... Please do not get lost again!
The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation
It does not stop
Hey, I am about to burst in this season
Surprisingly turning bullish
I want to be hugged
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.
I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around
I lose and come around, come around
By the time a white ship comes gliding through the beach
So that the distance between us may shrink
A little more... a little more... I try to close my eyelids
The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation
It does not stop
Hey, I am about to burst in this season
Surprisingly turning bullish
I want to be hugged
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.
I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around
I lose and come around, come around
This passionate, burning heat gives out a tingling sensation
