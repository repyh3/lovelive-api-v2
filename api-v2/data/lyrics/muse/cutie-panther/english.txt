I'm gonna get you!
(Where are you? There's no point, there's no point! Wherever you go, there's no point in running)
I'm gonna get you!
(Who are you with? That's no good, that's no good! You can't be with anyone but me)
So, so naive― With tools like that,
There's no way you'll be able to escape
I'm secretly setting my sights on you from behind
I love you! You're supposed to fall in love with me
I love you! That's the right thing to do
Hi, Hi! (How many times are you planning on making me say it?) Oh, oh my...
Hi, Hi! (If you're gonna resist, let me watch you try!) What a surprise
I know I'm being selfish
But the more skilled one is me
Cold words... A kind gaze... My prey is you!
I'm a cutie panther, following you wherever you go
I'll steal your heart away, just you watch
I'm a cutie panther, following you wherever you go
I won't, I won't let go of your heart
It's really hot. The rules of love
I'm certain they were made to be broken
My smile lures you towards my sly trap
I miss you! It's 'cause I love you, it's not my fault
I miss you! That's what serious love is
Hi, Hi! (Will I get absolutely everything?) Oh, oh my...
Hi, Hi! (If you're gonna resist, let me watch you try!) You're so stubborn
Instead of doubting, thinking it's fake,
try believing in me
Kind words... A cold gaze... My prey is you!
I'm a cutie panther, want your eyes to be on me
I'll steal your heart away, just you watch
I'm a cutie panther, want your eyes to be on me
I definitely won't let you get loose
Hi, Hi! (How many times are you going to say it?) Oh, oh my...
Hi, Hi! (Don't try to resist it!) What a surprise
I know I'm being selfish
But the more skilled one is me
Cold words... A kind gaze... My prey is you!
I'm a cutie panther, following you wherever you go
I'll steal your heart away, just you watch
I'm a cutie panther, following you wherever you go
I won't, I won't let go of your heart
I'm gonna get you!
(Where are you? There's no point, there's no point! Wherever you go, there's no point in running)
I'm gonna get you!
(Who are you with? That's no good, that's no good! You can't be with anyone but me)
I'm gonna get you!
(Where are you? There's no point, there's no point! Wherever you go, there's no point in running)
I'm gonna get you!
(Who are you with? That's no good, that's no good! You can't be with anyone but me)
