Run away, run run away
What is this all of a sudden?
Run away, run run away
Suddenly we're celebrities
Aah... Don't tell me this is our big break?
We'll survive this with a smile, run run run away!
It's strange, I'll close my eyes and take a deep breath again
It's strange, am I seeing a dream?
Let's pinch each other, until it hurts
It's not disappearing, people are chasing us even on this street
It's not disappearing... it's not disappearing!
We don't even have the leisure to be grateful
It's a ？←heartbeat that remains surprised
The happiness is overwhelmingly sudden
We can't seem to move on to the future from ？
Well, what shall we do?
Run away, run run away
What is this all of a sudden?
Run away, run run away
Suddenly we're celebrities
Aah... It seems our fate is changing
We can't quite calm down, run run run away!
It's joyful, but suddenly it's escape time
It's joyful, but actually there's no time to enjoy it
Should we disguise ourselves tomorrow? Are sunglasses necessary?
Let's run across this street to our usual spot
Run... run!
The fact that you loved us
Was surprising, but a wonderful HEARTBEAT
We're lost in a parallel world
It's a fantasy that we can't escape from
Well from here on, what shall we do?
We don't even have the leisure to be grateful
It's a ？←heartbeat that remains surprised
The happiness is overwhelmingly sudden
We can't seem to move on to the future from ？
Well, what shall we do?
Well from here on, what shall we do?
