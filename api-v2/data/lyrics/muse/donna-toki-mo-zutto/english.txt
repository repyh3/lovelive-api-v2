I'm feeling happy, so I'll go see you
I'm feeling lonely, so I'll go see you (Going to see you)
That's the feeling I have
Whether I'm moving forward or whether i'm in distress
We'll always be connected
With our earnest dream (Hi! Let's go!)
We'll capture tomorrow (Hi! Go go!)
If it's you, I know you definitely can do it!
Every now and then, let's take things at an easier pace
And take a good look at the things you want to do
From there, try your hardest with all of your might! (Let's work hard!)
And let our clear feelings soar into the sky
Every moment, I'll always be gazing right at you
I'm feeling happy, so I want to be by your side
I'm feeling sad, so I want to be by your side (I'll be with you)
Even if I can't say anything,
I wonder if you'll try embracing me
I want to tell you… that I love you!
Serious dreams are (Hi! Let's go!)
Just a little bit bitter (Hi! Go go!)
When it gets painful, let's just laugh it off
You gently and strictly encourage me
All these thoughts and wishes, let's grant them all
So let's work hard together with all of our might! (Let's work hard)
We will shine brightly in the future
Be strong, don't stop being yourself
Be strong, you don't need to rush accepting yourself
That is the most important thing
Every now and then, let's take things at an easier pace
And take a good look at the things you want to do
From there, try your hardest with all of your might! (Let's work hard!)
And let our clear feelings soar into the sky
Every moment, I'll always be gazing right at you
Because I'm happy, I want to meet you
Because I'm lonely, I want to meet you
Whether times are fun or sad,
I will want to meet you no matter when
