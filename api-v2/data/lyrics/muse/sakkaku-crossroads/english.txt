I thought I knew you better than anyone else
But was it just an illusion? I lost my love....
There's a reason that we met
One day you said that, didn't you?
I nodded as you looked me in the eyes
Our futures becoming separate was impossible
If we return (But to where?) Where would we return to?
All the times our feelings passed each other by, I don't understand
More than your words, I believed in the heat of your fingers as you touched me, but
Why did you say farewell in such a cold voice...?
I thought I knew you better than anyone else
But was it just an illusion?
That's right... I'm a fool...
We always liked the same things
Was that just a coincidence?
It's too late, you're this dear to me
Your heart's separated from mine, and I can't reach it, but
Embrace me (your scent) in this familiar fragrance
I want to stay immersed, as my tears quietly fall
Even right before my eyes, you're distant from me
Why can you smile so peacefully...?
I thought you'd never change
But when the illusion ended, I lost my love...
Talking to you normally is too painful
I'm like this, (strength) I don't have, please understand
Even right before my eyes, you're distant from me
More than your words, I believed in the heat of your fingers as you touched me, but
Why did you say farewell in such a cold voice...?
I thought I knew you better than anyone else
But was it just an illusion?
That's right.... I want to go back... to how we were that day....
