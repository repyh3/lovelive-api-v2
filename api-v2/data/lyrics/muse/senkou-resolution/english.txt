Doing things firmly
The me today
I'll throw my weak heart into the night sky
Doing things firmly
The me today won't flee, I can run into the darkness
While regretting, we'll pass through this
Don't quit, there's definitely a different path
The light I once wanted to see, the light that dwells within my chest
I realise that now is that time
While feeling a burning awakening
Light is pouring down, the light that dwells within everyone
Why don't we believe in our smiles and advance?
Still existing
The me today
Wants to become strong, so as to stand by you
Still existing
The me today can win, I can seize tomorrow
Even though I can't say it, I was happy
That there existed someone who knew my loneliness
I wanted power, power to protect my dream
We're still in time, let's rise up
The light of dawn illuminates us
The power that can revive, a power that protects everyone
So I smiled close to you
The light I once wanted to see, the light that dwells within my chest
I realise that now is that time
While feeling a burning awakening
Light is pouring down, the light that dwells within everyone
Let's believe in our smiles and advance
I wanted power, power to protect my dream
We're still in time, let's rise up
The light of dawn illuminates us
The power that can revive, a power that protects everyone
So I smiled close to you
