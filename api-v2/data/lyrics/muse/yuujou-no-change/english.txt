So don’t feel down
Hey…Are you listening?
Our friendship won’t change, It’ll be fine
I understand you’re falling in love
I understand that it’s something wonderful so
I hope no matter what you definitely won’t let it go
You’ll understand after losing it
I understand it’s precious but
Another chance will come swooping down evenly
Sadness resembles a cold, How about you rest?
“Take care of yourself” Soon you’ll feel better
So don’t feel down
Hey…Are you listening?
Our friendship won’t change, Come here
Always being earnest is something we share
I think we’ll be together forever
I want to do amazing things
I want to see new things
Don’t panic, Our instincts aren’t mistaken
You’ll get discouraged by the difficulty (Don’t get discouraged)
Can you summon the persistence? (You can)
If you don’t persevere success will recede into the distance
For now could our adversaries be our own weaknesses?
“Don’t give up” I’m by your side
Now I’ll embrace
Your heart tightly
Don’t be shy, Come here
I’m serious, I feel it strongly
Don’t worry even if you cry suddenly
So don’t feel down
Hey…Are you listening?
Our friendship won’t change, Come here
Always being earnest is something we share
I think we’ll be together forever
Yeah, It’ll be fine!
La la la…
