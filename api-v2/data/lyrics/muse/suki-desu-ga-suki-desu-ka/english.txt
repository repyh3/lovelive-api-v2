Wow wow Loving you!
I like you, but do you like me?
Because I like you... yeah yeah!!
Loving you!
Welcome back, look over here
Loving you!
Welcome back, today's ending is... yeah, yeah!!
Let's purr and relax here together~ (Purr! Purr!!)
Close your eyes for a while, let me massage your back (Rub! Rub!!)
With stewed soup always prepared
If you're hungry, how about it?
I don't have that much confidence but... I did my best!
Because I like you, since I like you, just saying it isn't enough
Because I like you, I want to do this for you, making any number of wishes
And so, only me (Oh yeah, oh yeah!)
That's the only person I want you to look at (Only look at me)
I like you, but do you like me?
Because I like you... yeah, yeah!!
Loving now!
Good work today, come over here
Loving now!
Good work today, was it tough on you again? yeah, yeah!!
Let me pat your cold cheeks to warm them up~ (Pat! Pat!!)
If I attract you a little bit more, I'll just hug you (Throb! Throb!!)
The room's neatly cleaned
With a small flower as decoration
How's the look of my apron... I did my best!
I like you, but do you like me? I have to confirm it no matter how many times
Since I like you, I want to tell you again, I want to convey it to you every day
That's because our (Oh yeah, oh yeah!)
Love can't possibly end
All of your painful thoughts, I want to make you forget them
Am I necessary to you? Tell me, Please!!
Because I like you, since I like you, just saying it isn't enough
Because I like you, I want to do this for you, making any number of wishes
And so, I want you to look only at me
I like you, but do you like me? I have to confirm it no matter how many times
Since I like you, I want to tell you again, I want to convey it to you every day
That's because our (Oh yeah, oh yeah!)
Love is something I want to protect (I won't let go of this love)
Wow wow Loving you!
I like you, but do you like me?
Because I like you... yeah yeah!!
