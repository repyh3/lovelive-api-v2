The fallen leaves being swept away by the wind; the light watching over the night
Where can you be at this time
If we're friends that's great but, if we're lovers that's just terrible
The pendulum of hesitation can't be stopped
The words of "I like you"
Flowing out of my wet eyes is a secret
My present... future... they exist in you
My wishes are bursting out of me
I won't voice them out but because they won't disappear
They're knocking on the door
I want to open up... but... it's frightening
To open up is frightening
So as not to awake from this still unseen dream, and I'm scared
The Terrible of stars
In the eastern sky there is a faint sign of tomorrow's coming
The today I spent thinking about you is ending
If it's a coincidence I wonder if it'll be great, if it's suddenly it'll probably be terrible
This excitement of wanting to tell you can't be stopped
"I like you" is just painful
When my sadness overflowed, I decided
My heart's present... future... if it's with you
It wants to become one with you
If I don't say it, it can't be conveyed
Don't throw away the key
If... I want to try and open up... I'll have to step out
I want to open up my self
Just that if I lament for love only, nothing will change
If we're friends that's great but, if we're lovers that's just terrible
The pendulum of hesitation can't be stopped
My present... future... they exist in you
My wishes are bursting out of me
I won't voice them out but because they won't disappear
I want to open up the door... but... it's frightening
I'm scared, Spicaterrible
My present... future... they exist in you
My wishes are bursting out of me
I won't voice them out but because they won't disappear
They're knocking on the door
I want to open up... but... it's frightening
To open up is frightening
So as not to awake from this still unseen dream, and I'm scared
The Terrible of stars, Spicaterrible
My heart's present... future... if it's with you
It wants to become one with you
If I don't say it, it can't be conveyed
Don't throw away the key
If... I want to try and open up... I'll have to step out
I want to open up my self
Just that if I lament for love only, nothing will change... I want to change!
