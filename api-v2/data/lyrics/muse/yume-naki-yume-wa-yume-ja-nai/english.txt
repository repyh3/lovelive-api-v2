Running through the wind
You’re running again today
My eyes follow as you sweat on the school grounds
No matter how far I’ll notice at any time
“Do your best! Don’t get crushed!”
My heart shouts out
If you’re serious a chance will come
You have to catch it
Before the throbbing in your chest disappears
Look, I say fight! For your sake
I’ll push your back with a smile
Become number one, It will be you!
I say fight! That’s my cheer
You’re still on fire
So definitely don’t give up
A dreamless dream isn't a dream
Raindrops are glittering
Glittering on your face
I want to wipe the dirt off the ball
Even on days like this you have to bring out all of your spirit
“Do your best! Stand firm!”
I’ll embrace you with all my heart
You’re serious, The sparkle in your eyes
Looks dazzling
The flames of battle rage
Now, I wish you to fight! I’ll push your back
Toward whatever you face
I can see number one, It will be you!
I wish you to fight! That’s my cheer
I’ll protect you without fail
No matter how formidable the foe
Your dreams will be victorious, They can be victorious
Look, I say fight! For your sake
I’ll push your back with a smile
Become number one, It will be you!
I say fight! That’s my cheer
You’re still on fire
So definitely don’t give up
A dreamless dream isn't a dream
