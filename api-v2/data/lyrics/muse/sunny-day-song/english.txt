This dream is fun, isn't it?
Let's sing all our joy with smiles on our faces
That signals the start of everything
One step at a time, from you; One step at a time, from me
We want to go somewhere. To the stage in our hearts
Trying to accept each other
We'll hesitate a bit at first
But there is a place that can accept us for who we are
I keep on wanting to know more and more...
SUNNY DAY SONG
SUNNY DAY SONG, fly higher and higher
I feel like we can overcome anything coming our way
SUNNY DAY SONG
SUNNY DAY SONG, whenever we hum it
Our hopes for tomorrow grow and grow, it's a great feeling
SUNNY DAY Wow! Sun power!
SUNNY DAY Wow! Song power!
This dream makes me happy
Let's talk about everything we can
That signals our bond
The second step is taken firmly. The third step, confidently
We dance feeling like we can go forwards without fear
If you try reaching out to anything
It will become much more enjoyable
SUNNY DAY LIFE
SUNNY DAY LIFE, let's shine the brightest that we can
What should I say to be able to share how I'm feeling right now?
SUNNY DAY LIFE
SUNNY DAY LIFE, you can dance along if you want to
Embraced by the thought of happiness, I feel like we can do anything
SUNNY DAY LIFE
SUNNY DAY LIFE, let's shine the brightest that we can
What should I say to be able to share how I'm feeling right now?
SUNNY DAY LIFE
SUNNY DAY LIFE, you can dance along if you want to, ah!
SUNNY DAY SONG
SUNNY DAY SONG, fly higher and higher
I feel like we can overcome anything coming our way
SUNNY DAY SONG
SUNNY DAY SONG, whenever we hum it
Our hopes for tomorrow grow and grow, it's a great feeling
SUNNY DAY Wow! Sun power!
SUNNY DAY Wow! Song power! (Sing it)
