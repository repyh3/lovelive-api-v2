With a smile, I say "I'll go on ahead" and get on the train
My lips quiver slightly
As painful emotion runs through me
If I could just tell you my feelings
I wouldn’t sigh and do things like write
That single name on the glass with my finger
I wish I could become crystal clear
As I stand in front of you as your friend
This throbbing in my chest that can't be kept hidden--
I don’t want anyone to notice it
Return the person I was, with her heart on her sleeve
Even though we're friends, I'm in love with you
I can’t hide it anymore, I can’t forget about it
With the secret locked within me, I leaned against the window
As the scenery streaming by changes, tears come trickling down
I play it off by pretending to yawn
And look up to gaze outside
Having you near me is painful
You're just too kind
Knowing you've made a habit of talking to that girl
Is breaking my heart
Someday, I want to dream about being tied together
The way lovers are drawn to one another
It's my selfish desire, my painful wish
I don’t want anyone to notice it
I wanted to dream about our hearts being tied together
Obtaining the happiness that lovers have
My selfish desire -- I'm sorry, without a doubt
This secret, marginal love will remain mine alone
The day we first met won’t fade away even now
Why does it continue to sparkle within my memories?
I wish I could become crystal clear
As I stand in front of you as your friend
This throbbing in my chest that can't be kept hidden--
I don’t want anyone to notice it
Return the person I was, with her heart on her sleeve
Even though we're friends, I'm in love with you
I can’t hide it anymore, I can’t forget about it
With the secret locked within me, I leaned against the window
