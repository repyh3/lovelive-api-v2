Everyone advised me to do it, so I did it
I became student council president!
My mom also went to Otonokizaka High,
And I share love for it
Things got serious for a while
And our school was nearly closed down!
I met everyone here, I met µ's here
And working together, we've managed to make it this far
We sing for today, facing the future
And we watch as the world slowly starts to spin around!
Yes!
