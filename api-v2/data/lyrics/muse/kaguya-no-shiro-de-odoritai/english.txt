Come! Come! Dance again seductively
Come on, come! To Kaguya’s castle
Our fateful encounter is a manipulative mystery
A perilous persona
Let’s dance! Let’s dance! The Dance beat won’t end
Come on dance, let’s dance! At Kaguya’s castle
Laser beams pierce the night sky
Will you watch with me?
The dazzling stars illuminate these feelings
Oh dream, last forever
I want to forget all about tomorrow
I’m the princess of red roses, I want you to make me yours tenderly
I gently whisper and meaningfully avert my eyes
You’re the knight of the white moon, The hand I felt is still warm
Don’t let go and hold me tight
I call this miracle love
Come! Come! Dance again with passion
Come on, come! To Kaguya’s castle
The energy engulfs any hesitation
Passion doesn’t sleep
Let’s dance! Let’s dance! The Dance beat won’t stop
Come on dance, let’s dance! At Kaguya’s castle
The discothèque intertwines the constellations
Stir me up too
My heart vows upon the twinkling stars
A transient dream is fine
Tomorrow will take care of itself
I’m the princess of black roses, I want you to make me yours passionately
So I smile and my eyes invite you to chase me
You’re also the knight of the black moon, Warmth lies deep in your eyes
Seize me and hold me tight
This miracle is called love
I’m the princess of red roses, I want you to make me yours tenderly
I gently whisper and meaningfully avert my eyes
You’re the knight of the white moon, The hand I felt is still warm
Don’t let go and hold me tight
I call this miracle love
