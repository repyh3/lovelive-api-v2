The door to our dreams, I've always been searching for it
I've been searching for a connection between you and me
Yes! Believe in yourself, believe in everyone
Tomorrow is waiting, so we have to go
Yes! Stars of premonition are falling upon our chests
Shine... When you're lost, just stand up
When I was tired, you encouraged me; your smile is the best
And so, I'm advancing little by little
The key to excitement is right here
The door to our dreams, everyone is searching for it
Wishing to find the meaning of our encounters
The door to our dreams, I'll always continue to search for it
It's the season for you and I to set off on a journey
Chance! My own feelings are, everyone's feelings are,
Overlapping and growing, unfolding together
Chance! Let's leave it all to the wave of hope
It's wonderful... The Power to continue to wherever
My eyes are lenses to my heart, leave your smile upon it
Soon, will this become only memories?
Such a thing, don't think about it right now
The future of hope, no one knows where it is
I'm running to find and determine it
The future of hope, if you'll always continue following it
A door will open up within you and me
The door to our dreams, everyone is searching for it
Wishing to find the meaning of our encounters
The door to our dreams, I'll always continue to search for it
It's the season you and I set off on a journey
It's the prologue of our youth
