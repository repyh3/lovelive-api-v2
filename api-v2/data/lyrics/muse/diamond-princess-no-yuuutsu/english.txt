Why do I feel so cold? (feel so mute)
Being stared at with intensity (feel so dizzy)
I wanna get fired up yet why (feel so nude)
Diamond princess style
Even if I carry a brilliant shimmer
Something’s missing…Agitating my heart
Things like pretty girls swaying in dreams
Are affairs which should stay in movies
That’s something no one understands
Begone! Words like “Protect me…” won't leave my mouth
Rather than being a frail and fragile thing, I want to melt in the flame of passion
You up to the challenge?
Love me to the point of caution (get my love)
I wanna cry painfully (Trembling all over)
Closing the lid on reason (get my love)
The princess wars are gonna break out
Seduce me, embrace me madly
If I forget about it all… I won’t need tomorrow
Rather than a guardian clad in light
I whispered that I want the fragrance of darkness instead
That’s no good, huh? You don't get it
Visions of a disappearing future -- nobody wants to see that
Do you understand? A frightened prince is a bore, you know
I want to stay the way I am -- electrifying
Sparkling princess, Sighing princess
Being ordinary’s a no-no, no more safety
While I, the melancholic princess, am awake
I want my heart to be thrown into disarray
Things like pretty girls swaying in dreams
Are affairs which should stay in movies
That’s something no one understands
Begone! Words like “Protect me…” won't leave my mouth
Rather than being a frail and fragile thing, I want to melt in the flame of passion
You up to the challenge?
