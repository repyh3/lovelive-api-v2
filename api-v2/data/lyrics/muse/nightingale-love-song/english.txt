Can you cage me?
Only just for you
The melody I want to sing right now, is a poem of love
'cause I'm in love I'm singin' love
Just for a while in this windswept night, I want to know your heart
"I should give up", I thought
But that's impossible, and when I finally realised that
I decided to live true to my heart
Always
Pursuing it,
Holding it close,
In the excitement... The feeling of love I want to give you
Always!
Don't erase this melody
For our story, the day when we can become happy has come
Within my wishing, hurting heart
Can you cage me?
Only just for you
The melody I want to sing right now, is a poem of love
'cause I'm in love I'm singin' love
That which I love, is right in front of me
Voices also contain warmth, a way to convey my feelings to you
It may be a frail sound but that doesn't matter
When I put my feelings into them, these words become passionate
That's why
Even while hesitating
Even in the midst of tears
While receiving... The feeling of love I want to give you
That's why!
While embracing this love song
Our encounter was for us to be entwined like a fairy-tale, right?
The dream I want to try believing in
Will be held close to my heart till dawn
The Nightingale that wants to play this tune
When did you also enter this cage without me noticing
Always
Pursuing it,
Holding it close,
In the excitement... The feeling of love I want to give you
Always!
Don't erase this melody
For our story, the day when we can become happy has come
Within my wishing, hurting heart
Can you cage me?
Only just for you
The melody I want to sing right now, is a poem of love
Within this cage with only the two of us, I'll sing a poem of love
'cause I'm in love I'm singin' love
That which I love, is right in front of me
