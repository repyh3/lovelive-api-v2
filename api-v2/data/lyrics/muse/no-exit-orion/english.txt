I don’t know your true feelings
You forget and mistake our promises
I want to know but I’m scared
The me that’s smiling like always is quite cruel
Please don’t give me a ranking
I want you to tell me that I’m the only one
Constellation of winter please give me strength
and invite you to the Orion with no exit
I want to confirm this love under this night sky with just the two of us
Who else do you need? You can’t decide that you don’t need me
I won’t let you escape
From the darkness
Don't run away, please don't run away...
My passion can’t be stopped
It’s bigger and stronger than yours
From the start, I felt that it would be a painful dream
But the brakes were already broken
Throw away everything except me
I want you to tell me that's your only wish
Even though the frozen sighs were calling your name
They closely missed the lights of Sirius in the frozen sky
After the sun rises will this love disappear?
Please don't let me think that this is nothing but an illusion
I love you I love you please tell me the painful truth
Don't run away, please don't run away...
After the sun rises will this love disappear?
Please don't let me think that this is nothing but an illusion
Constellation of winter please give me strength
and invite you to the Orion with no exit
I want to confirm this love under this night sky with just the two of us
Who else do you need? You can’t decide that you don’t need me
I won't let you escape
From the darkness
Don't run away, please don't run away...
