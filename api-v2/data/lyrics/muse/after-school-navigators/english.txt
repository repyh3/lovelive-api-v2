Let's nom on cheeseburgers on the way back
Or slurp some ramen!
But munching on waffles suits girls better
What should we do? Can't decide? Yep!
Should we go? I want to go
If we can't decide, we should just go
We can't even decide it by majority vote
After school, after school
It's not good to be too greedy
But our expectations are rising
My heart is pounding
After school, after school
Will it be sweet? Let's caramelize it
Should we give up if it's spicy? If it's just a bit, it's stimulating!
Rather than stammering "Well, but--"
If you like it, just say so
Regrets don't suit you!
I want to say I'm having fun every day
Even if it's not much, it's still a happy moment
You want to say you're having fun every day, right?
Since we're so close, we can share these thoughts
"It's so yummy!"
We can't stop eating
We want seconds
We gulp down our drinks at the same time
After school, we are NAVIGATORS!
Yeah!
Eat, drink, laugh!
After eating, I'm thirsty now
Slurping this ramen makes my forehead sweat~
I want to munch on these waffles forever
What should we do? Are you satisfied? Yeah!
Let's buy it and see; I want to buy it
Let's find out how it tastes!
It might have some maniacal flavor
Tea break now, tea break now
It's not good to stuff your mouth too much
Because before you know it
Your tongue will be shaking
Tea break now, tea break now
These octopus dumplings are so hot!
Shall we cool down with a polar bear? I want a lot, not just a bit, please!
Say things like "Look... I want more..."
There's nothing wrong with liking the things you do
No need to reconsider
I want to say I'm happy forever
It's best when there's a blue sky in my heart
You want to say you're having fun forever, right?
Since we're so close, we can nod and agree - "It really is yummy!"
Yummy!
I want to say I'm having fun every day
Even if it's not much, it's still a happy moment
You want to say you're having fun every day, right?
Since we're so close, we can share these thoughts - "It's so yummy!"
We can't stop eating
We want seconds
We gulp down our drinks at the same time
After school we, after school we, after school
We are NAVIGATORS! Yay!
Yeah!
